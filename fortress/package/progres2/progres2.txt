setup:

progres2.bsp goes in drive:\quake\fortress\maps
tf_flag.mdl goes in drive:\quake\fortress\progs

Server info:

This is a large map as you can see.  It should support 32 players.  Playing with too
few players will be boring, so get a bunch of doodz to play! :)
You should have as much horsepower as you can muster.  Also a lot of ram.

General overview:

Get a rune from your base and place it on the correct pedistal in the enemy base's
flagroom.  Doing this will activate a 'helper' for your team.  They are as follows;

	First rune)  Gives your team access to your teams wind pipe.
	Second rune) Gives your team access to a small 'base' in the enemy base.
	third rune)  Unlocks the flag door and gives you access to the enemy flag.

Then take the flag back to the circle in your teams base for a capture.  WOOP!

Scoring is as follows;

	Capture a rune)   3 frags for your team + 1 more for the AP.
        Capture the flag) 10 frags for your team + 3 for the AP.

All runes and flags etc. for your team are reset when you capture the flag.
When a flag or rune carrier is fragged, he drops the item.  It can be picked up 
by members of his team or it will return after a while on its own.  Eneny players cannot
return the item.

There are 2 areas on each base that can be accessed by a detpack.  They are water pipes 
that are capped.  The one into the enemy base can be fixed by an engineer.

Map is VISed for transparent water.
