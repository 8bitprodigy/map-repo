* Map Details *
This map contains two bases opposite each other with a covered barricade in
the middle. The ONLY flag on this level is on top of this barricade. Inside
the outside barricade there are two cages operated by two buttons on either
far end of the structure. These cages give access to the roof of the barricade
so the flag can be captured. Once a player has the flag, he/she must get it
into the ENEMYs bases flag room (glowing block).

If you like this map, email the server operator to tell him. Any comments,
ideas for other maps, etc. can be sent to mark@barney.dungeon.com
Enjoy!

* Other Info *
This level was started just as Quakeworld went 32 players, and the call for
32 player maps for Team Fortress went out. I was designing for about 2 weeks
then ran out of ideas so I left it for a couple of months. Recently I thought
it was about time to release another map or two, so before starting another
map I thought I'd finish this one. After a couple of LAN games to test it
(8 to 10 players) It wad ready to release.

How to use this map:
Copy the hextf.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map hextf" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the hextf.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory or your quake\fortress\maps dir.
