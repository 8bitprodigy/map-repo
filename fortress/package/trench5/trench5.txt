Known Bugs              : One really wacky bug. Sometimes when you get gibbed you reappear

* The Aim *

Very, very simple. Get the flag ! Return it to your bunker. 

There is a resupply pack in each central fort.

There are 2 ways into the other teams underground bunker and only one exit.

	1. Through the bunker entrance - also the way out.
	2. Quick teleport entry - two of them

Nothing else complicated in this level. Should be plenty of scope for lucky
long range shots though. 

Please watch out for the next level - coming soon to a web page near you 

		ESCAPE FROM COLDITZ - THE TEAM FORTRESS LEVEL

Yes I know I've been watching too many bad black and white war movies !

Have fun !
