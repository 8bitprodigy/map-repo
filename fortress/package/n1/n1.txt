======================= Installation ===================

 This archive contains 3 files:
1) n1.bsp
   Place it with your other Team Fortress maps.
2) n1.txt
   This text.
3) recharge.wav
   Place it inside the "sound" directory. It was taken from Descent I (the
   sound it makes when the ship recharges its energy)

======================= Game Play =======================

It's a TeamFortress map, you know the drill. N1 is simple in structure yet
very well-finished and almost as complex as 2fort5 in terms of strategy.
It was made with clan battles in mind but also works well in public servers.

NOTE: I recommend a fraglimit of 500, since every capture scores 50 points.
