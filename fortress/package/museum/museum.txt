Description: 

A very strange creative new map. 2 Teams, 1 is the group of security guards
that guard the artifacts and take care of the museum. Team 2 are a local
mob trying to break in and steal some artifacts for a little black market
cash.

How to use this map:

Unpack museum.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory. If you want to run
it on a LAN server or just take a peek at it, load quake with -game fortress
and type "map museum" in the console to load it. 

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the museum.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory.
