/////////////// Read below for playing properly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ or just run around like a Idiot /////////////////////////////  
*Install*
Copy the 2fact1TF.bsp to the Fortress\MAPS (DIR) and bigbang.WAV to
the Fortress\SOUND (DIR).


*Important*
Make sure you put the 1 sound file, bigbang.wav,
into your SOUND directory in TF (If there isnt one make it)


*Game play*
Ok then this is an Enhanced CTF ,When you start the map you will see your
normal FLAG on a little pedistal the Ped.. opposite is the Standard FLAG DROP
point.
Then there are 4 more flags in the next room, these Flag's are the Enhanced
part of the map.

                     ((((Important))))) 
You can drop the flag with dropitems,BUT Dont drop 2 things at once.
>use INV at the console to see what you have.<

You cant drop your level upgrade's just Flag's and Rad suit's.
E.g. if a HWGUY has the Enermy flag give it to a Scout for speed reasons,
 he can then give it back to you in your base:). 
		     (((((((end))))))))
*Enhanced part*
Skilled player's only ,Get the Enermy FLag and take it to the Enhanced.Flag's
in this order .You need a NEW Enermy FLAG each time.
Like CTF your FLAG must be safe,this level is ment to be hard.

1.Yellow flag this is the first step to the TOP.
Dont go near this Flag, once your above that Level it will take
the Enermy Flag and give you nothing.
 
2.Green flag .step 2 getting good (invisable)

3a(Blue Team).Blue Flag ,Now your Captain of your Team (Quad Damage)
3b(Red Team).Red Flag   ,Same

4.Mixed flag this is the TOP .(invincable) Once it gives you your prize
push the mixed Flag again wait a sec and then get the GOLD key.
Go to the Middle Bilding and open the Door 
Dont let the other Team down the HOLE or BUNKER as I call it.

<Important: Dont touch the yellow flag when going to the next flag in line,
 it will take the Emermy Flag from you.>

*The Bunker*
Once in the bunker swich the lights OUTSIDE the inner ROOM on 
and get all your Team in.

Swich the Standard BUTTON not the PLANET one to close the doors.

Once all your TEAM are in and the doors shut hit the planet Button once
and wait.enjoy.

///////// Below is not needed to play the map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*Map Story*
Your 1 of the last 2 Faction's and there's only room for 1 Faction.
so the 1st to get in the old Nuke bunker can blow the rest away
for good.

*Story Behind the map*
Why this design it seem's small, I play as HWGUY and sometime's
stand alone without even a gun shot in hearing distance so I
closed the base up tight without all the long tunnal's which most maps
have.The action will take place between base's with every one involed,
and no single player should be able to go it alone you just wont make it.

Why not more complex well on the net teamplay isnt that constant,
to play tricky maps ,so on my map the player still do what they know,
run like a nutter and run back,but you will need some help.

I played as all classes testing the map there is something for every one.
Excepted Det door's(demoman),Leg room(Scout),still lot's for them. 

*Changes from F,Beta*
Took truck's out.
Changed bunker a bit.
New long water tunnal between base's(from Red to middle as HWGUY no key I
 made it with 6% health from 100%). 
Change upgrade's levels.
Took out 3rd team and there ent's(radio\restock\spawns).
Seperated bunker Suit's.(see map macker's).
Made it's visual faces lower,for normal Quake.
Got ent's down to 190 that leaves 310 for in game.
Put special door for blue team above key drop.
Your keep you Level when you die ,But not the effect.
 

*Map Mackers*
Dont have 2 TF Goal entitys giving out the same thing touchable at onces.
e.g. in the bunker are 4 radsuits(info_tfgoal) if you could touch 2 it
would CRASH.

To Make items(item_tfgoal) droperball is Goal_activation 4096 
Not Goal_result.

I couldn't get the Enginner's spanner to work a door. I tried 
Goal_activation 8 ,worked for anyone.Goal_activation 4 ,reversed Team_no.
set Team_no instead.(can anyone help)

*Wouldcraft*
The best ever EDITOR, The key to editing quake is a line somewhere in the
WC Tutorial's it is something like this
" Treat it like LEGO just stick Block to block "
REMEBER DOOM\DN3D sidedef's,linedef's just to move a wall offten killed the level.  

*Ented*
Well what a tasty little program, I was doing a complex entity level,then
I read TFmap and decided ctf would do and then I found Ented v2.?.
Whitch was easy just point and click, but one day my map went back in time
by about 3 days work almost all the TFent gone(gutted).even with that delay
Ented saved week's.V2.5a took about 5min's to load my level .V2.5b about
5 sec's and there both as stable as it get's or need's to be.
Well what a tasty little program.

*TF Bot's*
Iv done the bot's for all my maps,but you will have to wait till the
 Bot bloke send's them out.
