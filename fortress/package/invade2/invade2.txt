Title          - Invade the Castle
File Name      - invade2.bsp
Author         - [NERD]Brain
Description    - This is a Team Fortress map for Quake. It isn't like the
                 2fort maps mainly because there's only one fort. One team
                 invades the castle, while the other defends it and all the
                 relics inside, which act like normal Quake powerups, except
                 that the effects last until it's dropped. Either team can
                 use the relics, but only one relic can be used by someone
                 at a time. If someone has a relic they cannot pick up
                 another one. However, they can be dropped using the
                 "dropitems" command, where another one can then be picked up
                 Once the item is dropped the effects wear off. There is also
                 an ancient scroll, which is the main goal of the invaders.
                 The invaders are to grab this scroll and bring it to a
                 sacrificial altar. This will cast a spell which kills
                 everyone, except for the caster (is he really safe?), and
                 give the invaders 10 points. The ancient scroll can not be
                 dropped like the relics, and can be picked up along with a
                 relic. Sound complicated? It really isn't. Just bind a key
                 to "dropitems" and the rest is basically kill, destroy, and
                 kill some more.
Installation   - Put invade.bsp in the /fortress/maps directory, the sounds
                 in sound/items, and the models in the /progs directory.
                 This map should replace the previous version which is now
                 outdated.
Credits        - Hexen 2 for the extra models and sounds
Single Player  - Only to look around
Multiplayer    - That's what it was designed for
Deathmatch     - Maybe, but it's best for teamfortress
Editors Used   - WorldCraft for the actual level and Quark for extracting
                 textures and learning about the entities and how they are
                 done on other maps
Building Time  - About 3 months
Flaws          - None

Relics         - Holy Relic          : Gives extremely durable armor
                 Invisibility Potion : Makes one invisible
                 Magic Helmet        : Gradually replenishes ammunition
                 Tome of Power       : Gives extreme power to weapons and
                                       grenades
                 Randomizer          : Has various effects at random times
                 Amulet of Life      : Regenerates health and armor slowly
Hints          - All items return 60 seconds after they are dropped, unless
                 they land in lava, when they return significantly sooner.
               - The Holy Relic gives very strong armor, so strong that
                 rocket and grenade jumping does not work nearly as well.
               - If some unfortunate person falls off the edge in the altar
                 room, the ancient scroll returns immediately. This is to
                 make it so that no one has to wait around a long time for it
                 to return. It will not return if the carrier dies before
                 hitting the bottom (hit by rocket in mid-air, suiciding in a
                 panic while falling, dropped scroll missing the ground, etc.

Revisions      - Added a secret teleporter to the battlements, but the secret
                 can only be opened by a button hidden somewhere
               - Changed how the main goal kills the user. It no longer kills
                 slowly, but only once. It seems better this way because the
                 user kept getting hurt after he restarted. That is fixed now.
               - The ancient scroll is now glowing so it can be easily seen
                 in dark places.
               - Minor texture changes
               - Changed some deathtype messages
