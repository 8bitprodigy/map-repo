==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress CTF 2fort5 style map. If youKnow 2fort5 you
know this map. 

There are two teams to this map. Red and Blue Each has a base
Clearly marked with Cerberus's 3-headed dragon. I sometimes play
Auto team so I marked each base and resupply room with that teams
color. This way if you pick auto team you will know what team you
are on as soon as you spawn.

Each base has an outside sniper deck that is only accessible from
an inside and the elevator leading to it works for both teams. 
The map has a jail cell and teleporters like the Rock1 & The Rock2.
If you try to enter the enemies resupply rooms you will be stripped
of all ammo and grenades and thrown in jail. There is Where I differ
from The Rock. Once in jail you will be given the 666 Pentagram. 
This keeps the enemy from getting a cheap frag, and makes it in 
your teams best interest to bust you out. The cell door can detpacked
open and closed. If you have the flag when you get thrown I jail you
keep it. This is even more incentive for teammates to bust you out.

There is a can of superbeer on the bridge that when capped will make you
7 foot tall and bulletproof. Well not really it will give you & your
team 5 sec of quad, heal some health and give some ammo but not allot.
You keep the can till you die and the beercan, can only be capped once 
every 30 sec. You can't enter your upper resupply with the super beer.
if you do you will get thrown in jail.
