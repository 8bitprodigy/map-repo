  This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own base,
  at opposite ends of the map.
  It is intended for a small game, anywhere from a 3on3 to a 4on4. Any more players and the level of teamwork         required to cap i have rarely seen in a game of TF. not to mention the level Spam that would occur   
  This my second map for QWTF. check out boon.bsp if you can find it.

How to use this map:
1. Copy the unsung.bsp file into C:\quake\fortress\maps
   directory. Then run quakeworld client.
2. Connect to a server hosting this map.

Or for a pointless single player game:

1. Copy the unsung.bsp file into C:\quake\fortress\maps
2. Create a shortcut of your quake executeble
3. Edit the shortcut proporties so "-game fortress" (without the quotes) is included in the command perameter
4. fireup Quake using the shortcut then in the console type "map unsung" (without the quotes)
