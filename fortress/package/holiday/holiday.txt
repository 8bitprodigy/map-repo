General things:
==============

Installation:
------------
unzip Holiday.zip to a temp directory
move  Holiday.bsp  into your quake\fortress\maps directory
move  flagtk.wav and flaget.wav   into your quake\fortress\sounds\misc directory


Performance:
-------------

If you own a rather fast computer (let's say a P120+ with (more than) 16 Meg) you might
 be able to increase your system performance quite a bit:

Just add to your command line:

	-r_maxsurfs 1200 (or more)
	-r_maxedges 3200 (or more)
        -heapsize 16000 (or more)
		

REMARKS:
--------

For all the Gl-ers out there: We tried to make Holiday playable for Gl also.
			      Of course the color intensity with some textures
			      and the lighting is not as contrastive as one might
			      wish, but we tried our best to make it appealing enough
			      for both Gl and regular players.

Map overview:
-------------
2Forts Holiday Edition is a map recommended for about 18 players.


The scenario:
This map is basically like the 2fort series maps. We added some new tactics though, like a
shootable door in one of the sniper lofts. We added palm trees to provide some cover from
snipers.

This means:

The flag is located in the cellar of each base.
The touchdown point is, standing in front of your base, on the right sniper loft.
