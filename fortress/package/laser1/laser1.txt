Description             : TeamFortress Quake Map
                          Cap the flag on the runway going accross the
                          middle room. The original theme of this map
                          was lasers, but I had to remove them because
                          they were causing major problems. I may add
                          them in the future. Look for Laser2 map,
                          that will be it's name. I will most likey add
			  new sounds to this map as well.
