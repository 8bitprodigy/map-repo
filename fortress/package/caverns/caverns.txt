
8/12/98 - w00 my first map is finally ready for public consumption! =)

======================= Map Information ======================== 
 Title : The Caverns
 Filename : caverns.zip
 Author : Snowden McNab (teehee)
 Email : fade@snowcrash.org
 Web: http://www.snowcrash.org
 Description : TeamFortress v2.8 Quake Map

======================= Installation ======================== 

-caverns.txt
    You are reading it now.
-cavenrs.bsp
    The map file. Put it in quake/fortress/maps.  Duh.

========================= Game Play =========================== 

2 bases (funny how red and blue always build right next to each other),
2 flags, 2 ways into the flag room.  Close up the detted wall with
another det.  (Detted wall, what...?)

This map is best played with 6-8 people per team... more would most
likely be way too many.  For extra fun, turn on teamkills (teamplay 11)
and then be careful. =)

This map ain't pretty.  It was built simple so I could use the large
areas I wanted.  If you want pretty maps, go play a souped-up 2fort
clone.  I suppose I could have put in some ambient sounds... maybe
next map. ;p

Flag Status lines blatantly ripped from EWG2 (me favorite map).
