** Game Rules **
================================================================

Capture the enemy flag located on the upper floor of the enemy base. It is accessible by ramps behind the main room. Take the flag back to your base's capture point centered in the main ramp room for 10 frags and 10 team points.


================================================================
** Additional Information **
================================================================

Excelsior is based off my old QuakeWorld TF map of the same name. The map was so awesome, several TF and TFC clans named themselves after it. :) 

The map has a simple, but very open, layout that hopefully will make the map offense oriented. My original intention for the map was to make a map with an ambience to it that differed from all the TF maps around. Most people seemed to think I succeeded. I'm not as happy with the way it turned out for TFC, but it still has a unique feel to it; a dirty, dark feel that's lacking in TFC. Hopefully it will have the good old Quake TF feel to it: low lights, no lab textures, etc.

The lighting of the map provides dark areas for offenses (or defenses) to hide in. Because the lighting is colored, some players may try to hide their team color by sitting in shadows. This should add a very new amd interesting aspect to gameplay. Defense be wary or you may let opponents slip by, or worse, you may end up shooting your own teammates fearing the spy. There are several dark corners in the main ramp room for the spy or offensive sniper to hide in. I hope you enjoy this map, as I tried to make it differ from the bland 2fort style.

=================================================================

-=Details=-
Capture the Flag style Team Fortress map. Flag return time at 60 seconds. Dropitems enabled.
Two teams. Two bases. Lots of fun.

-==SCORING==- 
A) 3 TEAM POINTS and frags are awarded each time the enemy flag is removed from its pedestal (not everytime it's touched). 
B) 7 TEAM POINTS and frags are awarded for the succeasful capture of the enemy flag.

-=Outlook=-
Flags are on the upper floor of the bases. Capture the flags on the pedestal in the main ramp room. There is a sewer system that connects the two bases. Everything else is pretty standard.
I kept the design of this map simple: straight forward "Capture the Flag". The bases are none too complex, but features wide halls to make for great fighting with few bottle-necks. There is no deck-to-deck sniping, rocks separate the view between the two bases. This makes field sniping much more accessable.
