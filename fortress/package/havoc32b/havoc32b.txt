                          Fortress Software, creators of my -only- reason
                                to play QUAKE anymore
                          The whole Children of Chaos gang, especially the
                                new guys, Berzerker and Fdisk... welcome
                                to the gang
                          The Quakeworld team... high-pingers like me could
                                not survive without them!
                          id (of course!)

Release Notes:

4/15/97
        Constructed the main of the Blue Base [the Red Base is just a
        retextured mirror].  Ran into a snag with the TF entities; doh!
        Found TF entity problem [forgot to give spawning players a goal].
        Designed some map bits in downtime, including what would be added
        on as the Main Spawning Room.

4/16/97
        Assembled, tested, and compiled the map; sent it to WarpHammer for
        constructive criticism, adjusted the environment accordingly.

        There's only one computer console in the Control Room, which is less
        of a room and more of a concealed access to the Main Computer; you
        can't get in there, which limits people laying around in the room.

        There are a lot of nooks and crannies to hide in: under ramps, on
        certain ledges, et cetera.  This base is designed for defense,
        although a crafty infiltrator has a few options besides frontal
        assault.

        Decided not to go with the door-side bunkers, went with a more
        traditional sniper loft.

        Demomen: check out the basement resupply packs... they have spare
        detpacks in them.

4/17/97
        Oops!  Forgot that there's less headroom for spawning players in QW;
        people spawning in one particular room would get stuck in the ceiling.
        Bummer.  Fixed that.
        Also changed some architecture so it's easier to get into the wind
        tunnels up top.
