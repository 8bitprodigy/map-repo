*********READ THIS......IF YOU ARE A MAC USER!**********
	You must create an alias to the files above in the fortress directory,
if you have problems, you may have to create files called progs/backpack.mdl,
and progs/b_s_key.mdl in your fortress directory.
	    
For some reason, Macs will not recognize the directory system past fortress,
If you have any idea why, I would love to know!!  Please E-mail me!  

	        
======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map.

	There are 4 teams.  Everyone starts in their own base, which
	is basically a small room on top of a tall block building, the gravity is
	set very low, so players can jump very high.  The object is to get to the
	key, which is on a platform in the middle, retrieve it, and bring it back to
	the goal in your base.

POINT SYSTEM:

        IF you can get to the key, and bring it back to your base,
	your team will recieve 5 frags.
