Description     : 2 seksi teams fight to see who can get off first. 
		  
Credits to   	: [SG]Llama2000 for making this lengthy text file for 2fortse for
                  me to gank.
                  Saboteur for starting this map out.  Without him I would probably
                  have not gotten into mapping again.  He did most of the structure
                  while I did the textures, entities, minor structure fixes and
                  additions, and the sounds.
                  Ambush for MTF.
                  Pablo and the new MTF dev team (http://sks.phpwebhosting.com/dev/)
                  And of course, id software for making quake!

                  I'll probably pull something even better out of my ass next time.
                  This is my first map after all.

--= Gameplay Notes =---------------------------------------------------------

I pimp this as being a 2fort5/h4rdcore mix with a bunch of goodies for people
to play with added in.  There's a hidden quad damage for scouts to get.  The 
buttons outside the respawns retract the bridges.  There is also a det spot
at the bottom of the spiral in each base.  This det spot closes the water 
entrance for the opposing base, so teams might want to guard them.  As your 
team touches and caps the flag they get more and more turned on.  Most likely
the team that wins in caps will jizzor first, and the other team will just be
sexually frustrated.
