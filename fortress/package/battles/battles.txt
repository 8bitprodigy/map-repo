Base                    : Got the idea when first played ENGBAT.  Other than
                          the idea, it is totaly from the dark recesses of
                          my mind.

Release Notes:

        Not-so-standard capture the flag game.  Each  team has two classes:
        a spy and an engineer.  The goal of the spy is to destroy the enemy
        sentrys that are build while the engineer has to grab the flag. Makes
        an interesting game.
