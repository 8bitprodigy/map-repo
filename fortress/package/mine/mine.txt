* Other Info *
If you like this level mail the server operators and let them know.

This is a large level.  There are 2 buildings with a rock slide between
them.  They are also connected by the mine.  The flags are in the mine.
Return them to the slipgate on the roof of your team's building.  There is a second slipgate which will open a lava pit in your team's key room.  Ammo is at the very back of the building.

How to use this map:
Copy the mine.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.  In the console, type "map mine" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the mine.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory.
