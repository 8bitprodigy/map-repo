        theft -- it's unpleasant to deal with.

Description &
Comments	 :This level is designed to be used in Tiny Team TF. That is
		the same as regular TF only with Tiny Teams. At the exit from the 
		spawn room is an invisible wall that resupplies the home team and
		strips the ammo and some health from a wandering enemy. Message is
		no respawn campers. 

        The overall look and feel of the level is a three-level parking
        garage -- sans cars. The key for each gang is stored under the ramp
        on the second level. The key return is the guard room on the lower
        level.

        The elevator doors on the third level do not work. That is a stub
        that will lead into the office building when this level is expanded
        for Quake II.
