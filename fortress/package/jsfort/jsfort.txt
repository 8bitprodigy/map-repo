======================= Game Play ======================== 
This is a standard Team Fortress "Capture the Flag" map.

There are two teams, Red and Blue. Each team must defend their castle and their flag, while attempting to steal the opposing team's flag. The objective is to steal the enemy's flag and carry it to the goal at the top of your castle for 10 points. If a player dies while carrying the flag, it will remain where the player died for five minutes before returning to its spawn point. Be aware, the "Ring of Invisibility" is hidden somewhere in the map. In the true sense of a ring, the wearer retains the ring until death (or they "dropitems" it? haven't tested with 2.6).

POINT SYSTEM:
Red- 10 points everytime the blue flag is "captured"
Blue- 10 points everytime the red flag is "captured"
