Special Instructions	 : This map is optimized for QuakeForge and 			   Mega2k! However, until QuakeForge better 			   supports sky boxes, in order for the map to 			   be viewed properly, the server admin should 			   run the map by executing the included config 			   file ("rcon exec granite.cfg") or the 			   players should load the skybox themselves, 			   by typing "loadsky badomen" in the console.
