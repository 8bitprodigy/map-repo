Known Bugs              : This is v1.3. It's not really a "bug" but I get
                          this all the time: you can "step out" of the
                          transport Chinook. That's because the visual and
                          physical helicopters are 2 seperate entities. The
                          "visual" one turns and the physical one doesn't.
                          Also, starting QWCL.EXE with a heapsize of 65,536

Other:
Playinfo                : This is not straight-CTF. The object is to get your
                          team's demoman behind enemy lines and have him det-
                          pack the enemy's critical possession. Reds need to
                          blow up the invading (Blue) team's supplies, while
                          the Blues need to assassinate the Red's commander.

                          Red and Blue Basecamps are *not* duplicates
                          of each other. Players will find their favorite
                          squad to join at map load: 1:Offense, 2:Defense.

                          BLUE TEAM INFORMATION:
                          The Blue team is the "invading" (offense) team.
                          Conquer Red's territory primarily by destroying
                          their chain of command. Assassinating he Red's
                          General (via detpack) gives Blue Team 10 points.
                          Blues respawn in a hovering Chinook helicopter.
                          AMMUNITION:
                            Ammunition can be retrieved from the back of the
                            Hummer or near the Supply boxes. Grenades and
                            Detpacks are resupplied inside the Blue's Cave.
                            BLUE SCOUT: Calls in Aerial support by turning on
                             the radio in the Blue's Tent. A Transport Chinook
                             arrives outside the jungle to transport Blues to
                             the Red's FrontLine. Red's may ride the Chinook
                             back to the Blue's FrontLine, as well.
                            BLUE DEMO: Scores points for the team by det
                             packing the Red's General (in the Reds tent).

                          RED TEAM INFORMATION:
                          The Red team is the "home" (defense) team. They are
                          trying to blow up Blue's supplies to keep them from
                          invading their territory. Destroying (via detpack)
                          the Supply boxes gives Red Team 10 points.
                          Reds respawn in the Hospital Tent (big red + ).
                          AMMUNITION:
                            Ammunition can be retrieved from inside the Red's
                            tent (where the General is). Grenades and Detpacks
                            are resupplied inside the Red's Cave.
                            RED SCOUT: Activates minefield by touching the
                             activation lever inside Reds Tent.
                            RED DEMO: Score points for the team by det

                            RED ENGINEER: Digs out "trenches" for Red team
                             with your spanner wrench. This will
                             expose long passageways that lead to the
                             Battlefield.
                            ANY RED CLASS: Activate the Tank by standing be-
                             hind the turret. Tank shoots twice every 10 sec.

Secrets                 : Wraith of clan Nebula found a killer spot to
                          grenade jump to, so I added a slow, lean goal to
                          restore his health, armor & ammo. You can't see the
                          goal, but if you find it it says "Wraith's Rock!"

Version Info:
                        : new in beta 1.1 (Public Beta)
                              Fixed goal messages. (doh!)
                              Added marching dogs.
                              Armors are now kevlar + wooden. (both)
                          new in beta 1.2 (Public Beta)
                              Added (2) Wraith's Rock goals.

                          new in v1.3 (Public Release)
                              Lots of fixes: reds can't destroy
                              blues supplies until they're back. (doh!)
                              All (hopefully) messages are correct now.
                              Resupplies give 100% of stuff the first time.
                              I'd like to think I'm done now :}
