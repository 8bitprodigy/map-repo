GAMEPLAY

Basically the same as usual. But this time there are mines to watch out for. get too close 
and BOOM! In case you do step on a mine the usual procedure is to jump 50 meters in the
air and scatter yourself over a large area, remember it well. You can mark the mines with
in the dark fields with lights by pressing the buttons, the first button (marker) puts a 
limited light around the mines on your side. The flood buttom will completely light the 
field and show a little of the enemy field. The flag is held in a pipe in the bottom of 
the fort. just take it to the battlements on your side and capture it. You can make a 
hoice of what you gain when you cap the flag. As well as a full heal for your team and 
points you can also choose one of the powerups for ten seconds.

Soon: 2mfield4: The last version
