* Changes from Dragon God *

-Added lights and shadows.
-Added locs.
-The wall at the end of the capture corridor now pushes you in the opposite direction at 600 speed.
-The spawn doors will no longer teleport enemies to lava (must enter opened spawn to trigger teleporter).
-Fixed spy's undisguising issue.
-Fixed flag capture message.
-Minor texture changes.

* Story *

The Water Dragon and the Fire Dragon are two of the six dragons that make up the Dragon God. They have time-traveled to the year 1997—two years before the Day of Lavos—in order to prevent Lavos from ultimately becoming the Time Devourer. Both dragons have a plan to destroy Lavos before Crono's party can (leading to the Time Devourer timeline), but each dragon's plan requires utilizing the power of the other. Thus, water and fire element users have been directed by the dragons to capture each other's flags as much as possible.

* Details *

Dragon God was intentionally made with only Quake101.wad textures and has some visual similarities to 2fort5r, but it is designed for modern gameplay. While making my guide to every QWTF map (qwtf.org/Maps), the three most common flaws I saw in map design were (1) lack of space to move freely, (2) lack of creative inspiration, and (3) too much concern about the technical details of mapmaking. Before making Dragon God, I had the basic layout in mind, with the goal of making a map that would be fun to play for every class.

The double dragon door from the spawn into the yard is one-way to prevent defenders from guarding that area with a continuous refill. And so that door opens from the inside only. Otherwise, dragon colors indicate which team can open a door. Blue can open blue, red can open red, and either team can open yellow (the Earth Dragon is neutral). There is also spawn-camping protection to stop attacking players from trying to enter the enemy spawn.

* Inspiration *

These maps directly or indirectly influenced the creation of dragongod: 2fort5r, poop, shoop, excel, japanc, openfirer, h4rdcore, preskool, canalzon, caverns, well6, impact1, optics6, civsaw1, 32smooth, cyanr, fatta2, 2sphinx6, 8-1, r123, tfc-demolish_b2, ff-schtop, ff-phantomr, blitzkrieg2, rs_zzr, genders2, ff-siege, rcktjump, mountdoom, utumno.

* Research *

Dragon God is intended to have similar timing to the maps that are most frequently played in FortressOne. Thus I went through each of the top maps as Spy and tested how long it takes to bunnyhop from my spawn to (1) my own flag (simulating defense timing) and (2) the enemy flag (simulating offense timing). The results show that the expectation is that it should take about 9 seconds for the defense and 17 seconds for the attack to 'feel' right. Dragon God is close to the average of the most-played maps, slightly on the faster side.
