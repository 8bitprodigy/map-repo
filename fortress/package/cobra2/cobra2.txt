                          RVis - this map is NOT vis'd for transparent water
                          Why? No need, it'd ruin the effects.

Known Bugs              : I hope you have 16mb RAM or you might as well stop
                          reading right now and get another map. :/
                          -Also it IS possible to get stuck behind the
                          buttons in the infocenter..but I don't feel this is
                          worth recompiling the lvl to fix because it's
                          almost impossible to get stuck back there unless
                          you try to.

                          not have been told ;)
Tested With:            : P200MMX, P233, Quake, and QW. [should run fine on a
                          P90]

Optimal CLient          : GLQW running on a P133 /w 16mb RAM

What's New in revision C -

        -Fixed disc's not returning if you died while carrying them.
        -Added messages for the disc's return.
        -Actually gave the map a real name.
        -Re-did the disc.mdl, it now actually has a skin and on top of that,
        I think it looks quite nice.
        -I uhm..updated this txt document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
--------
Layout:

There are 2 bases, with parts of each base being unlocked when you bring the
enemies disc[new flag] to any yellow teleporter symbols on the ground. [For
further info go down to the Scoring section.] The enemy key is on the 4th
floor of their base, and hopefully it won't be a 1 man job to take the flag.

The bases are connected by 3 areas:

1.) The sewers underneath the bases. [which are _very_ simple, even though
they may look daunting at first.]
2.) The teleporter array by your teams main respawn room teleport you onto
the enemies teleporter pad outside their base.
3.) There is a skyway on the 3rd floor of the bases that connects the bases.

Oh yeah, I threw a secret somewhere in there too ;)

Scoring     
---------

There are 4 places you can take the enemies disc:

1.) Bringing the enemies disc to the symbol in your HQ gives everyone on your
team 15 [maybe 10..I forget] frags.
2.) Bringing the enemies disc to the symbol in the room down the hall from
the armoury unlocks the armoury doors. [Trust me, it _definitely helps your
team out]
3.) Taking the enemies disc to the symbol outside your bunker opens the
bunker doors.  The bunker is a defensive position that allows snipers to
snipe enemies teleporting into your base with moderate security to their own
well being. [I tried to make it where it's impossible for a sniper to _easily_
cover the pad, it should be noted that it isn't impossible, and relitively
easy, to avoid being hit by a sniper.]
4.) Taking the enemies disc to the security checkpoint on the 4th floor
enables your early warning system which warns you of enemies near your flag.  

Notes/rants:
-----------

This map was designed with playing as a _team_ in mind, I hope that you think
about that before you go charging off into the enemies base all by yourself.

One other thing -- There have been a few [very] complaints about clipping,
but they are -MINOR- gripes..they don't detract from the level nearly enough
to warrant it's unplayability.. So you know those clipping problems were not
a fault of mine but were a result of the shoddy carving routines used in the
level editors.. (no offense, but the WorldCraft carves never worked right
for me..) :(
