* Game Play *

This is basicaly two forts in the sky, where if you fall off the bases
you will fall to your death! The flags are located in a room in the
bottom of each base that you can only reach by teleporter in the middle
room of the base.  You cap the flag in the middle room of your base on
the blue square.

 * Final Words *

I realized after creating this map that Quake does not like wide open
maps like this one.  I have tried to eliminate any problems that led
to any severe lag.  There will be another version to be released after
I recieve more feedback and suggestions.  I would love to hear your
opinion and you can find me at the following:
