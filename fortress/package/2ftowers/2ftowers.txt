What's included inside this ZIP file, and what's more helpful, the directories 
you need to place things into.

You might already have these files, especially the wavs, but they need to be in
the directories I called out since that is where the map will look for them. 

Software needed to play :
(ctf, normal quake etc.)  Quake (registered) and TeamFortress (not
                          really needed but kinda boring without it.)


Comments                : Two Fort Design.  You must get the key to unlock the 
                          door to your enemies flag room.  The keys are kept 
                          high in the Battle Room.  There are quite a few places
                          for snipers and others to camp in.  I believe TF was
                          pretty much designed around defense and offense.  Well,
                          for those that don't understand defense, that means 
                          you find a good place to wait, ambush and kill your 
                          attacker, or what is commonly called "Camping".

Thanks:  Id Software, the greatest of games.  TeamFortress, making a great
         game even better.  QuakeWorld and GameSpy, I never knew life on
