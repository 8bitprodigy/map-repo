======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map designed for up to 32 players on 3 different
teams. This map has pretty much the same goals as border1. One team tries
to make it out of the compound (team 2, the crazy monkey people) while
another team stops them (team 3, the scientists). The final team (team 1,
the elders) protects their monkey friends.

POINT SYSTEM:
Blue Team - 1 frag everytime a Crazy Monkey Person Escapes.
Red Team - 5 frags everytime you escape.
Yellow Team - No special frags. Just kill the Crazy Monkey People and
	their defenders.

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Lately, my friend, Dyorthwang has been obsessed with playing border1
(for good reason :). I decided to make a similar map, with a few of my
own ideas. This is in no way meant to replace border1, just a similar
map. I hope people enjoy the scenery.

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake,
Strato[CE] for the sample readme.txt, >V<Someone for border1, and 
Blood of the Fold for all of their support in my mapmaking abilities.
