Synopsis:  Two teams face each other across a fortified battlefield.

Scoring:  There is a single flag that starts in the center of the field.  A team scores 10 team points and 10 frags per team member by carrying the flag to their opponent's goal, which is the large gateway directly inside the enemy base.

Layout:  Each team has a Home Base which guards their goal.  The Home Base faces a Front Area.  The Front Area has a route to the Water Area and the DMZ.  A Forward Base looks out on the Water Area, DMZ, and Front Area.  There is a single Center Base that sits in the middle overlooking the DMZ.  The DMZ is the center open area, both Forward Bases and the Center Base face the DMZ.

Supplies:  There are Resupply Stones (partial ammo/health/armor) in each of the Forward Bases and the Center Base.  All Resupply Stones are usable by both teams.  In addition you are fully stocked when you leave your respawn room.

The Flag:  You glow when you carry the flag.  If you die you drop the flag, and it stays put for 60 seconds before returning to the center of the DMZ.
