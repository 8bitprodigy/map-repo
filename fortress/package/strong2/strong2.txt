======================= Game Play ======================== 

This map consists primarily of two castles facing each other.  What makes this map fairly unique is that you can run all the way around the castles, not just the front as in 2fort5.  There are also a few side points of interest which add a lot of fun to the map: demomen can blow a hole in the back of the castles, and can close the holes  as well; there's a well behind each castle which leads to an underground tunnel connecting  both wells; there are two smaller towers in the water between the two bases connected by a bridge - one of which has a trigger to raise and lower the main bridge between the castles. Note: The main castle doors must take at least 250 points of damage before they will open and bring up the ramp covering the moat.

======================= Known Bugs =======================

This release fixed many bugs in version 1. No known bugs exist in strong2. 
Please submit bugs to stronghold@clan-eha.com


======================= New in version 2.0 ===============

- Slime darker, making it easier to tell apart from grass
- Wall infront of respawn room extended a bit infront of windows to block snipers
- Fixed the lighting in the bottom of one of the wells where it's too dark
- Red and blue dragon banners fixed so they don't flicker black in glquake, same with main doors and blown walls
- Added refill packs to respawn rooms
- Dimmed light source near respawn to reduce flashing effect on exiting
- Adjust height of tower in between castles, too allow for better targeting from 
  windows to castle tops and vice versa
- Changing texture of hillside to make it easier to differentiate from sides
- Added EHA banner to outside wall
- Added respawn message

=========== Misc Information ======================== 

This map uses no custom .wavs or .mdls - which makes it a fairly small file - 930K, which is smaller than most maps out there.

This is my first map. When I started this map I didn't even know how to use WorldCraft or Ented. Thanks to those who let me know how much they love this map, and thanks to those who didn't, but didn't say anything...

Several things could have been done better, but this was my first so cut me some slack.  Any suggestions are appreciated and may be incorporated into the next release of this map.
