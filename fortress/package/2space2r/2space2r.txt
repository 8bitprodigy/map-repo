Description             : Two team, CTF style map.                      
================================================================
This map is a straight forward variation on the CTF theme which I am becoming 
heartily  bored with! (The theme that is, not my map! My map is, of course, utterly 
wonderful, and  nearly as weird as I wanted it to be) I have, however, added 
a small weighting against snipers. The layout of the map says they will be vital 
in defence, but they cannot pick up armour, whereas everyone else gets kevlar 
straight from the respawn. Of course, an engineer can correct this matter somewhat, 
but that requires team work, something I have done my best to encourage, so I am 
happy with that state of affairs and will not be adding a large armour stripping entity 
in the forseeable future :o) Indeed, the most common route of attack should force 
attackers to travel in groups, and that will also make it easier for medics to stay with
them and ply their trade, the need for which will become quickly apparant! 
Team work is the essence of the game!
Version 2 has a mega health, if you can be bothered to walk that far, a lift at the 
flag end (version 1 players will be grateful), 2 big cruisers instead of just one, some 
different textures, a new model (with sound effects and a pickup message - yes, 
I fixed it), and the liquid space is positioned in the landing bay entrances instead 
of in the middle of the map. Think of it as a force field preventing explosive 
decompression :o) Oh, and I fixed most of the texture problems with the crates... http://www.squint.clara.co.uk/qwtf/maps/
