One slightly misplaced brush.. 
(sorry didn't feel like going through the whole damn compile process again for it.
I.E. It's free, don't complain.. :)
 
It is possible to get stuck in the crates by the mega health.

*note* I found a mis-aligned texture or two and I couldnt stand to
look at that misplaced brush. So I fixed it. But Im not gonna release
another copy and make everybody d/l the new one for 2 textures and a
brush. But if you really want a fixed copy send me an email.

// Overview 

This map started as just a pure TF DM map. and slowly grew into what
you see now. It's simple enough, Get the key(s) and work with your
team to stay alive and FRAG! FRAG! FRAG! :)


// Other Info 

If you have less then about 24 megs of ram.. this might get kinda slow in spots
