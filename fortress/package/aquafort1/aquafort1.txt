* Other Info * 
Description: Ok it's not the most spectacular map out, but it's my first complete map, so 
	     don't go critizing me be about it.  I would like suggestions on what should
	     be worked on, suggestions, and comments (good or bad).

	     Basically the 2 bases are identical except for a few textures to seperate
	     the two bases.  Each team has a computer room.  In that room, there is 
	     a key and a goal.  The key is in to top right corner of the room, and the
	     goal is the panel on the right wall.  You'll have to swim a little to get 
	     to each base, but their is plenty of Scuba Gear and 4 biosuits in each 
	     base.  9 supply bags in also present.  There's nothing new in this level,
	     because like I said, it's my first map and I'm using it to tutor myself 
	     on map making.  10 frags for each capture and that's about it.  Hope you
	     enjoy it.



How to use this map:

it on a LAN server or just take a look around, load quake with -game fortress
and type MAP aquafort1 in the console to load it.
