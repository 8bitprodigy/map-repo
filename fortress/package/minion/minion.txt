Description             : This map is made for the 
                          Team Fortress Patch (v1.3x or 2.0x). It won't be
                          fun playing it without the patch.

  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from

  This is a capture-the-flag map designed for two teams. Each goal
  is to capture the flag from the enemy base, and return it to your flag
  drop off point.

  The flag drop off point is a little circle thats located just outside
  the flag room at your base. You'll find it.
