Details:

This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2.8+ (who has any before 2.8??? :).
Gameplay:

You'll have to take the Detpack-Bomb from the middle of the bridge
between the two forts an drop it in the enemy fort
at 4 positions marked by flags.
After you did this job you (or a teammate) must release
them by pressing the button appearing on the old
capturepoint .
Each drop gets you 5 frags, the detonation 25.
The enemy will get -10 frags and -75 health
by bombing their fort (when he is in there).
Enemys outside will only get -25 damage.
Any player in enemy-fort who is not an enemy
(YOU :) ) will also get damage (-50)!
You'll need a Demoman to drop all 4 Packs...gues why :))


p.s. You get killed after dropping any Packs or pushing the button 
to prevent a bug in the QW's .mdl-handling...
And it's not that easy to get the pack again either :))




Changes:
A lot... from 2fort5bo till now ... :)
History:
1.0 First 2FortSEBO release...
1.0a added thebomb.mdl
