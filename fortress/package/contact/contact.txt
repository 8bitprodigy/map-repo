Known Bugs              : There might be some grey-outs (and perhaps slowdowns)
                          at certain positions in the level.. We didn't excpect the 
                          engine to be this fed up with big rooms - we'd reckoned 
                          the border to be a little bit higher...
                          -------> look at performance hints below.
			  Also some doors might sometimes somehow stick to your body
                          and hurt you a bit. We tried all possible measures against this
                          but none helped. We found a way to avoid this is to approach the
                          side of the door where the lock would be.
                          If You know why this happens please tell us....

General things:
==============

Installation:
------------
unzip contact.zip 
move  contact.bsp  into your quake\fortress\maps directory
move  macht.mdl    into your quake\fortress\progs directory


Performance:
-------------

If you own a rather fast computer (let's say a P120+ with (more than) 16 Meg) you might be able 
to increase your system performance quite a bit:

Just include these lines in your autoexec.cfg file situated in your fortress directory.

	r_maxsurfs 1200
	r_maxedges 3200

Also add to your command line	

    -heapsize 20000 (or more)
		
A different way not to increase the performance but at least to please the eye is to type 
the following command into your console:

r_clearcolor 296 

this will let the greyout turn into a 'blueout' to make it less disturbing. ;)

Map overview:
-------------
Contact is a map recommended for 18 players max.


The scenario:
Two bases situated half in water linked by an isle.


Contact is a classical Capture the Flag map (except perhaps that the flag is a thing ;) ). 
This means:

 Get the enemy thing by going on top of the roof of their base and falling down the tunnel to
 the basement.
 there either shoot the switch to open the water door or head up again....
 Touch down at the glowing wall with the tech symbols situated in your ramp room / your lower 
  sniper balcony.
