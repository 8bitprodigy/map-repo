  This is a two team capture-the-flag(key) map. Each team has their own base,
at opposite ends of the map. (Where have I seen this sentence before ???)

  The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
key which is in their computer room located on the top level.

  Score 10 points for a key capture and 5 points for detpacking the 
ememy main computer (Just behind the key) and the lucky detpacker gets
rearmed.

  The key gets returned to the main computer, just behind the Key in your
base (Top Floor). This will give everyone full Cells and Medkits on
your team. (Cells and Medkits you ask see bellow). 

  The grappling hook has been removed in this level (leave it to the rocket
jumpers to attack the base-second level).

  The Spawn rooms are also the resupply points if this is a disadvantage then get
some engineers to do some building. The doors close after 1 second (Hopefully to 
cut down on some spawn point campers). (Hope this works)

  There are a few ways into each base front door and up the ramp or take the wind
lift at the back, under water (one intake tube , one outlet) or rocket jump the
front wall.

  There are also two towers per base which give a great view but well ... a 
bit cramped.
 
* Map Design *

  I believe that there should be some sort or incentive for key capture 
and cells give engineers the required material to construct/repair 
various items and the Medkits for the Medics, the Pryos also get some
ammo but they are a short range weapon. So while giving the Team a bonus
it doesn't instantly put the other team at a disadvantage i.e. Give 
out quad, ammo or amour and then the other team will just get there butt
kicked even worse.

  After playing the various TF maps out there I decided to have a go myself
with the goal of combining the elements I like about various different
maps out there ( 2fort4 / sfort / e1m1 ).
  I also read as much as I could find about map making and QW limitations etc.
So with all this in mind the largest Poly count is just over 500,so there 
should be no gray patches and it should run at a descent rate with 32 people
around (I Hope). 

* How to use this map *

  Copy the bases.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map bases" (without the quotes)

  If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the bases.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory.

Have fun.
