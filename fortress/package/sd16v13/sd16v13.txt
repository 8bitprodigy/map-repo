* Other Info *

  This is a combination two team capture-the-flag map and damage the enemy team's control room map. 
Each team has their own base, at opposite ends of the map.

  The primary objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
flag which is across from their control room. The flag must then be returned to the
control room of their home base.  The secondary objective is to damage the enemy's control room by
firing at the two computer panels at either side of the control room.

  There are resupply points on the first and second levels of the map.

  The frag count of each player should be their team scores plus any frags they accumulate by killing the
members of the other team.
