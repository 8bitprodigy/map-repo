Additional Notes        : The 'tower' referenced here is a 'tower'
                          of people, not an actual level comprised
                          of a 'tower'. Go figure. (See below for
                          further details)

======================= Game Play =======================

This TeamFortress map was made specifically for TGTOATFIP 
(The Great Tower Of Assorted Team Fortress Items Project), 
therefore normal TF gameplay (CTF) is not possible as there 
is only provision for one team, and no team objectives.

For info regarding TGTOATFIP, contact Insanity.
