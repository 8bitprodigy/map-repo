* Other Info *

This is my first full level for Quake, and since I've been
playing a lot of TeamFortress recently, it seemed only natural
to make another map for it.  For some reason, I'm out of room
for entities in Quake, so I don't have deathmatch starting
points in the level yet.

If anyone knows what

"Host_error: Too many static entities"

when loading a map in Quake means, or how to get around it,
please let me know.  It seems to have a limit of about 150
entities...

I'd also like feedback on speed of the level.  I have a
Cyrix P150+ w/ 32M, and don't really have access to a slower
Pentium, so I have no idea of what performance would be like
on such.  I have simplified the level a bit as it is, but
let me know if it's too much.

Now about the level itself.  It's a night level with a lot
of open flame. :)  The main feature is a hedge maze between
the two fortresses.  I've run vis at level 4 on the map, but
in a couple of places on the back of the roofs, there is
still some grey that appears occasionally.

The following is from 2fort23.txt (a big inspiration for
this level; thanx to John Cook), and it applies here, too.

  "This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team
   has their own base, at opposite ends of the map.

   The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and
   capture the enemy flag which is in their basement.
   The flag must then be returned to the [pool on the
   roof] of their home fort.

   There are [two] resupply points on the second level
   of each fort.

   The frag count of each player should be their team
   scores.

   How to use this map:
     Copy the hedgfort.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
     or quake\fortress\maps directory. Then run quake.
     In the console, type "map hedgfort" (without the
     quotes)"


Please let me know any suggestions that you have for the
map; especially if it's TeamFortress related.  I've been
trying to make it balanced for TeamFortress play, but I
have yet to play it on a server.
