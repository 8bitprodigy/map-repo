* Gameplay *

Grab the key from the enemy's base and return it to the funky floor object
near your spawnpoint.

Exciting!

* CHANGES SINCE MUSKRAT 2 *

- Additional respawn rooms.
- It's possible to get from one base to the other without going
  outside.  It's tedious, but possible.
- The breakaway wall in the supply room and the hole in the field can
  now be detpacked from either side.
- The ammo packs give detpacks and less gren2s.
- Slightly lowered crenelations on sniper nests--damned QW2.21
  wussy-jumps!

* CHANGES SINCE ORIGINAL VERSION *

- Capture message now has a newline... oops.
- Armor Backpacks now actually give armor.  Big bug!
- Knobs in main field are bigger
- Ammo packs now give one gren1/gren2 when in enemy base
- The hallway to the key is wider.
- There are crenelations on the battlements.
- There is much less armor/health/ammo in the respawn room.
- There is a tunnel from the left side of each base (outside)
  to the cargo room of that base.
- There is a little health/ammo/armor for the enemy in cargo rooms.
- Realigned some textures.
