======================= Game Play ======================== 
Three Teams
1. Capulettes
2. Montagues
3. United Nations

The Capulettes and The Montagues are at war. They will kill each other on sight. Their goals are to steal the other teams key and take it back to their base. That team scores 10 points.

The United Nations is a bit different. Their goal is to keep things even. They will do this by taking a suitcase to the winning teams side. That team loses 10 points and the UN gains 5.

The UN can also affect the ammoboxes and medikits scattered around the map. There is a machine that the UN can control. The UN can Hurt or Heal anyone carrying a medikit once every 15 seconds. The UN can Add or Subract ammo from anyone carrying an ammobox once every 15 seconds. So while they gain fewer points from scoring, they have greater power in other aspects.

The UN also controls a teleporter pad in the church, their base. Anyone on the Capulettes or Montagues that stands on the pad will be teleported into the enemies lair when a UN offical presses the activating button.

There is also a simple subway system beneath the town. There are farecards to operate the turnstills. Beware that vicious third rail. 

All items in the map are droppable. If you dont like where your key is hide it. If you drop an item out of the map it will respawn again in its original spot.

POINT SYSTEM:
Red- 10 points everytime the blue flag is "captured"
Blue- 10 points everytime the red flag is "captured"
Yellow 5 points everytime the suitcase is "captured"
