* Map Info *

A snipers only map with a point!
You must keep at least one of your capture pads dark to keep the enemy
team from scoring.  Doors open every minute and capture pads stay dark for
20 seconds.  The enemy team will score if all your pads are lit for 20
seconds and at least one of their pads is dark.
If you find any problems, have any questions or ideas or you wish to make
donations please feel free to send me an e-mail!
