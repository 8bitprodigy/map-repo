==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress CTF style map.

There are two teams to this map, Blue and, rather predictably,
Red :)

Map features:

- Grapple hooks
- Duck!
- Moving water :)
- A working computer in each team's base
- Ambient sounds
- Anti respawn camping measures
- Anti flag hiding measures

Scoring works as follows:

- 2 frags per enemy flag pickup
- 2 frags per enemy flag capture
- 10 team points and 10 team frags per enemy flag capture

To capture the enemy flag, your own flag must be on its stand
in your flagroom. Take the enemy flag from their flagroom,
bring it back to your own flagroom, and touch it to your own
flag for 10 points for your team.

Due to the design and size of the map, certain classes have 
been made illegal, or restricted:

- No Scouts are allowed in this map
- Snipers and Engineers are limited to 2 per team

The computer
------------
Each base has a computer, located just outside the main
respawn. These represent the base controls, and an enemy team's
computer can be used one of two ways:

- By a spy, to allow teammates access to the flagroom
ventilation duct
- By an engineer, in order to override the normal flag return
rules and return their team's flag for a capture.


!!!! Server Admins note !!!!

Please, please for fooks sake, run your servers with at least
one of following config lines:

serverinfo grapple on
serverinfo g on
localinfo grapple on
localinfo g on

Theres no real reason any more to run with grapple disabled,
since the older tf maps which didn't disable it properly aren't
in regular use any more (I've not seen 2fort4 in a server
rotation for ages, for example), and the latest TF code doesn't
enable grapple by default.
By running your server with grapple enabled, you allow maps that
require it to be played correctly, as well as enhancing the
gameplay on maps designed with it in mind, but which may not 
necessarily _require_ it.

WaterCore NEEDS grapple enabled, or it becomes unbalanced for
certain classes re: powerups, routes through the map, etc.
I'd rather people didn't play it at all than played it without
grapple, because it's not how the map was designed.
(Plus I don't want 100 emails from people asking why certain
parts of the map are inaccessible to engineers/snipers/hwguys
etc :) )


=========================Misc. Info=============================

Thanks to ]SG[-CiderPunk for the top duck model, & [EQ]Babs for 
providing at least half of the music I listened to while working
on this map, plus countless testing & suggestions, none of
which I included when I think about it... well maybe one. :)
Thanks also to [EQ]Locki, for pointing out the lift 'bug' :)
and to [EQ]RainbowSix aka Rush, for providing an entire enemy
team for me to test my ents against, while Lox ran around
looking for misaligned textures and dodgy lights.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to cuss Ali bad for
being the most unreliable person I've ever known.

/me cusses Ali bad.

Thankyou.
