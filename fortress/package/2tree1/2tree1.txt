Description             : Hi!
                          
                          So, here is my map. It's based on the 2Fort
                          System, with a river in the middle, but
                          without Forts. In fact, the forts are
                          subterranean. I've always dreamt to have
                          platforms on trees for sniping. I tried to
                          build a map in a forest, but trees take many
                          brushes and Quake doesn' t like too much open
                          spaces full of polyhedrons, so I completely
                          changed my mind about the map but kept the
                          tree idea. Sadly, in this map, there is so
                          many sniping nests that the trees are a bit
                          useless (they're placed in the most open area
                          of the map..). The forts are basically
                          symetric with two main entrances and a subway
                          between both with an entramce in the river.
                          Those are obstructed with doors that will
                          open only for their team, but you can blow
                          them away with a DetPack.
                          
                          You capture the flag in front of the altar,
                          in the Flag Room. The capture gives you 15
                          frags and 10 for the team, to encourage flag
                          capture and not only killing strategy. You'll
                          also receive a 1 minute Quad, just in case
                          you would like to frag some people too.
