Game Play Notes:	This is command point capturing level similar to canalzon.  Take a 
			key from eighter of the weapons building beside the respawn building
			and bring it to a command point to capture it.  For every CP your
			team owns you will receive a frag every 30 seconds, also, a key
			will show up on the map on top of the corrisponding building.  
			To steal a CP simply capture it with one of your keys.  Do not 
			try to enter the enemy's building or you will be killed.  So 
			have fun!

For the Future:		The next version of this level will hopefully be for the TFC addon
			for Half-Life.  I plan to include respaen point in side the CPs
			which will activate will your team has it captured. I also plan to
			add another level to the buildings and possibly add more buildings.

Other Notes:		To date this is the only other CP oriented map other than CZ 
			that I know of.  If there are other please tell me.  Really looking
			forward to TFC, hope to see you on some servers!
