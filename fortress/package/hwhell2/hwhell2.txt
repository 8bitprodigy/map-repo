The Story So Far:

Once... there was war.

In the Volcano named for the god PELE, Archeologists and Plumbers declared war.
Trapped in the middle were the Government Officials who accidentally sent both groups to the same
Volcano with conflicting work orders.  They had come in to talk sence into the two parties.  The talks
failed, and chaos ruled the day.  The Plumbers called in supporters from the other unions.  The Archeologists
called in help from the schools of their University.  The battle became a war...
But that was long ago...

The war has continued for so long, many have gone mad.  They hear voices.  Many voices.  But they all say the
same thing:

PELE IS COMING.

The battle is rousing PELE from his centuries old sleep.  The volcano will not sit still much longer.

PELE IS COMING.

The Government men have mannaged to build weapons and traps upstairs.  They feel safe there.  But no one is safe anywhere.

PELE IS COMING.

The Archeologists had a major cave in long ago.  They pulled in support beams, and cleared it out as best they can.  The shovel
used to clear the last rocks is still in their treasure room.  It is said to have great powers...

The Plumbers were wiser.  They build simpler supports long before.  And they've mannaged to get some actual plumbing installed between
battles.  But they are not well...  they still hear the voices...

PELE IS COMING.

And after a while, they began to believe.  All of them.  PELE IS COMING.  It is no longer a thought of madmen.  It is now a fact in thier
lives.  PELE IS COMING.  And when PELE comes, nothing will ever be the same...


SACRIFICE.

THE ONE TRUE WAY TO A NOBLE DEATH.


			YOU  WILL  DIE  HERE


Welcome to Hell.


GAME PLAY:

The Archeologists and Plumbers are all Heavy Weapons Guys, but they are not alone.
The Plumbers have Soldiers and Engineers to help them.  The Archeologists have Pyros and Demomen.  Both teams can have Snipers.
But BE WARNED.  THIS IS HEAVY WEAPONS HELL.  The Heavy Weapons Guy has SEVERAL
advantages over the other classes.  They are here for support, not to rule the day.
The Govenment agents are team 3.  They are all civilians.  But they are VERY capable civilians.

GIFTS:

The gifts of Pele are as follows:
ARCHEOLOGISTS:  Invincibility.
PLUMBERS:  Quad damage.
The gifts apply to their goods(the "team flags"), and the Command points on their side of the map.  If you control the Archeologists goods, you get the Invincibility.  If you control the Plumbers goods, you get the Quad.  Simple as that.

GONVERMENT OFFICIAL powerups fall into a STANDARD CYCLE:  15 seconds ON/ 5 seconds OFF.  This is ALL G-men powerups except for the tall spire powerup.


SCORING:

Archeologists and Plumbers:  Can score 3 ways initially.

1. Command Points.
     ONLY HWGUYS can control Command Points.  The contracts are very specific on this point.
     The four points the government surveyor(who tragically died of multiple grenades 
     to the face) declared must be controlled to own the mountain.
     Unfortunately, the fighting has crumbled the ground around them, so they now
     sit in large pools of lava.  Every 15 seconds a HWGUY holds a Command Point, 
     the team will receive a point, AND the HWGUY will recieve a bonus(oh, boy!).
     The tall spire in the center room gives 2 points(oh, boy! part 2)

2. Capture the Flag.  
	ALL PLAYERS may capture the flag.
	If you can get to the enemy's base, you can steal one of thier
	Tools. The Plumbers can steal the Archeologists Digging Spade.  The Archeologists
	Can take the Plumbers Sewer Key.  Return it to your Fire Crucible for A TEAM powerup.

3. Kill the Government Officials!
	Always fun.  One team point if they have YOUR TEAMS GOODS.
	IMPORTANT!  If they have the ENEMY goods, and you kill them, YOU WILL GIVE THE 
	ENEMY TEAM A SCORE!!!  So don't just go off half cocked on the G-Men.


Government Officials Score:

1. Steal the enemy goods.
	The contracts permitting digging are hidden.  The plumbers have hidden it
	in thier Plumber's helper, and the Archeologists have hidden it in thier Ankh.
	There is POWER in these items.  GREAT POWER.
	The longer you hold these Items, the more the team scores.  And as long as you
	hold them, you gain GREAT GIFTS from PELE himself.
	Do not lose them!

2. The Central Command Point.
	PELE is impressed by courage.  Stand on the central spire before all others, and
	he will reward you and your team for your courage BEYOND your wildest dreams!!

4. DO NOT BITCH if you lose a lot as a G-Man.  No one wants to hear it.  You picked your team.
   Besides, Moriarty played as a G-Man solo against 16 HW GUYS during Fortress Fest, and 
   kicked EVERYONE'S butt.
   It CAN be done, if you play it right.  If you want to know how he did it(I sure as hell do!),
   visit-
		THE CITIDEL
		http://citadel.tfdomain.com/

He'll be glad to tell you all about it.

Heck, as long as I'm passing out URLs...

		BUNDY'S PLACE
		http://bundy.tfdomain.com/

That's the place where the sort of people who read readmes all the way through go.  You'll like it.



PLAY INFO:

The archeologists modified their ZERO-G artifact carrying devices so they could travel on
them.  But there was a short circuit, and they've been running rampant for years.  Watch out.
PELE IS COMING.  PELE doesn't LIKE runaway platforms.  BE WARNED.  He is powerful enough to destroy
ANYTHING he does not like.

If the Plumbers and Archeologists can keep the G-Men from stealing their treasure, 
they will receive gifts from PELE!  If the G-Men do get the items, then THEY recieve the gifts.

If you get lost, here's a handy guide:

Archeologists walls are BLUE and to the SOUTH.
Plumbers walls are RED and to the NORTH.  They have plumbing(duh).
The EAST and WEST lava rooms each has a HUGE letter E or W.  Figure those out.
Downstairs is darker.  Upstairs is lighter.  Yellowish color.


Remember:  ONLY by HWGUYS controlling the Lava Spires can the ENDGAME begin.

ENDGAME INFO:

PELE COMES.

WHEN PELE COMES, EVERYTHING CHANGES.

SACRIFICE IS THE KEY.


Known Glitches:

The Government Guys will occasionally survive more than twelve seconds.  I don't
know how they do that.  I'm sure it's some sort of glitch.


Version Info:

HWHell1.bsp: DECEMBER 2, 1997  3:31 PM
          Does anyone ever read this stuff?  I wonder about that...

revision d:  DECEMBER 9, 1997  4:12 AM and DECEMBER 13, 1997 9:08 PM
     	Final Revision of Hwhell1.  Many changes and fixes to the map.
	Fixed several minor map flaws. Fixed some punctuation errors.
        Fixed the part in my hair.  Fixed my cat.  Fixen' to go out.

HWHELL2.bsp   JANUARY 19, 1998
A COMPLETE overhaul and revision!  The changes are gigantic.  It would require a small BOOK to relate them all.  Here are the major ones:

1. Everything looks better.  MUCH better.
2. ENDGAME added.
3. New models.  Just added to avoid the confusion of 2 seperate ankhs and 2 seprate plungers.
4. Multiple classes allowed.  They are weaker than the HWGUY, but they're there.  NO Scout, Spy, or Medic.  I have
   VERY good reasons for this.  If you're curious, E-Mail me, and I'll send you the form letter.
5. DYNAMIC SIZE SYSTEM!  The map will adjust it's size AUTOMATICALLY to be the RIGHT size for the number of people 
   playing.  Scoring and resupplys are also altered to reflect the number of players.
6. And many, many more that I shant relate here.

revision A	FEBRUARY 12, 1998
Minor gameplay and ent update.

1. Pele Lag reduced by about 10-20% depending on YOUR computer and connection.
2. Grenade pack model changed to make it stand out better.
3. Government access doors to 3rd floor now AUTOTOGGLE every 60 seconds.  The G-Men can force it to open or close ONCE during those 60 seconds with thier axes.
4. Timing of various goals cleaned up and ballanced.
5. Minor bug where the Map would occasionally open early has been found.  It has NOT been taken out.  It has been modified.  Now, it's not a bug!  It's a FEATURE!  Random increase in map size will be VERY rare, but it will happen.
6. A few more fixes added.  Dropitems was supposed to be added to the G-Men stuff, but it doesn't work.

revision B	FEBRUARY 24, 1998
Minor update update

1. Grenade pack refills twice as fast.  Now gives Detpacks.
2. Autosizing timing refigured.
3. Now, for no reason other than it's fun, 2 minutes after the map begins, everyone gets 30 seconds of QUAD.  It's my map and I can do what I want.  :p

Currently, revision B is planned to be the FINAL version of this map.


Other Info:

The Lava is bad.


PLEASE report any glitches not mentioned here.  DAMIT!  I'm serious!
Hopefully, there aren't any.  But TELL me if there are.

Thank you all for playing.
