=======================Play Information=========================

This map does not work properly without the TeamFortress QuakeC
patch, which can be downloaded from
http://www.planetquake.com/teamfortress or from ftp.cdrom.com

For 2 or more players.


==========================Gameplay==============================

Teams 1 and 2, have a duel map, and 3 and 4 have a CTF style map.

Place the .wav's in your sound folder.

I have fixed up the many errors in Neo, and I give you Neo2. :D

Such as the detable walls, flag bug, and flag messages.

Enjoy.
