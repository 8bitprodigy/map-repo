* Stuff you should know *

	Ok, hey.. what's up? Anyhow, this map is entitled King of the Unf
and is a King of the Mountain style map. I got the idea for this map basically from Rocket Arena. I thought that there should be a nice way to compromise both Team Fortress and RA, and out arose KOTUNF!
	Basically, the idea is simple, two rooms, four pads, you score an individual frag (and a team frag) by standing on your team's pad and letting it rise to the top. Wait 10 seconds and another frag is yours, this continues until someone knocks you off. 
	The lava pit awaits you below! So watch out for those annoying grenades, and most importantly watch your step! Many a time have I fell.
	Engineers have been disabled mainly because Sentrys and dispensers would destroy this level. (Sorry Engineers.. hey, i'm an engineer myself!)

How to use this map:
	Copy the kotunf15.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\tf\maps
directory. That's it, you're ready to UNF!

Special Thanks:
	Thanks go out to the whole Clan!Remorse['81] crew! They've helped me with the map, suggestions, beta testing, etc. Thanks to Retribution for getting me into map making, too. Omi, t2, bj, philo, bruce, empty, etc etc etc. Prepare to unf!

Last Will and Testament:
	No, you can't use this map to build other maps on, I own you! Email me if you have any suggestions or comments.
