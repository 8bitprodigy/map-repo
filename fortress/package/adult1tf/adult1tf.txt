*Install*
Copy the Adult1TF.bsp to the MAPS directory in TF .

*Game play*
Real simple you can just play capture the Flag and/or Detpack the console
in the brain then the Flag man(only) can go to the Lung Teleporter,and then
the Hart ,were there's a Team Power UP.
The Flag drop point is above your flag in the brain.

*Map History*
I just wanted a level for the New TFbot's, because they can only handle
simple Tf goal's.
So I said to my self I'v got till 6am(it was 12pm) to have half a
CTF/TF map made and this was the Result, I thort you lot might like a look.

My Maps:
Now all my map TF maps are done they play in an order, whitch progress
in Entity Layout, so TFers relise SLOWLY TF isn't CTF.

Here's the idea:

2Fort_SK, Make the Players feel at home, By SK-realistik and SK-Imaginos. 
Adult1TF, Adult theme, But look Quake aint for kids(more funny then Sick).by me.
Comf1TF, The Next step let the Players HOLD THERE OWN FLAG, By Me.
2Fact1TF, My first and Fav map, Nice Ents(go look), By Me.
Colony1/2, Nice, Big, Hard, Ents:), By Shawn Schultz (Rizzen)
Collo1TF, Totally Removed from " Normal TF ", By Me. 
Hunted, Nice Map, Well you should know by now, By (I forget now).

With some other nice level's server owners could have a real nice Flowing
Anventure for like 4 hours, not just 2fort(CTF) every 1/2 hour.
Also having a smoother lerning curve. 

*Future*
I may do 1 or 3 more maps, probly Hunted style.
