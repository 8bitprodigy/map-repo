*NOTES*

Detpack the Enemy sniper dens to create a hole big enough to rocket/gren jump into. the flag is situated in a caven under the base, get there via water or go though the base...

V0.41

OK full water VIS its all see through awww. lifts have been lowered so thet you swim into them rather than jump onto them, to stop spammers, when u exit the respawn room u will be invunrible for 2 seconds, detpacks only damage the left hand sniper den now.  improved the look and speed of the underwater doors..

V0.33 Beta(final(final)) ;)

Added something to the sniper balcony, made the bottom sniper den lighter, added a flag on the outside of each base.


V0.29 Beta

Fixed a small bug which ment you could not use the underground lifts (QW2.2 Friction) made the lifts lower so they should work now..


V0.28 Beta

Replaced textures that looked out of place , made the spawn room doors look better and added steps from the balcony to the flag room.. 


V0.24 Beta

Linked the underground caven with the ouside by creating a water tunnel, created a flag room aswell as a couple of spawn rooms, ive added (most?) of the entities now, flags ammo etc..
the flag capture point is at the very top of the ramp room..
im going to tidy up the map, replace textures and get rid of bits of wall poking out maybe make the detpackable sniper dens more spectacular?


V0.21 Beta

made  the route to the flag room longer by adding an underground caven, no water passage yet but water will be linked into the caven, also made the sniper dens detpackable meaning that as soon as they are dtpacked soldiers can start rocket jumping...
no spawn rooms yet either BTW also adding some more detpackable stuff soon aswell...
