Title : 2 Forts. 1 Flag.
Filename : 2fortmrc
Author : David Neville
Email address : mercnary@softhome.net
Description : Two simple, two floored forts, complete with sniper decks. Each fort
	      is on either side of a central island, with bridges connecting the forts
	      to said island. Atop various ramps and pillars, a single flag awaits.
	      Beneath the water separating the islands from each other, a hidden room
	      holds the flag return area. Sounds simple, but in reality is a whole
	      different style of play when compared to most simple CTF maps.

Please, tell me of any bugs. Bugs suck. If you, for some reason, decide this is worthy
of play on a server, tell me also. I'd love to do something other than 1 on 1 with this
silly thing :P

Gameplay : Get the flag. Take it to the underwater flag return. Sounds simple? Good.
Be warned, though. A good sniper can keep the flag completely covered, so grenade
jumps might be in order.

Copyright : ...is pretty much nonexistant. I'm thinking about releasing the .map source for
it, if anyone really wants it that badly. Feel free to hack it up, change it, etc. Just,
please, don't cheat. I hate cheaters. Cheaters suck. But if you feel that the map absolutely
needs 40 quads thrown about, you're welcome to see it happen.

			Just don't expect anyone to play.

Release? Hey, do what you want, I could care less. Just, please, some recognition would be
nice. That goes for any modifications, changes, etc.
