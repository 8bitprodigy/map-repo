Description             : This map is made for the
                          Team Fortress Patch. It won't be fun
                          playing it without the patch.  Also
			  This TF level was made for 2 teams,
			  but with 3 forts.  Details below...

  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from

  This is a Team Fortress map designed for two teams.
  The goal is to capture the flag, that's located in the enemy base.
  Then, you have to return with the flag to your own base, and stand
  on the circle in your base.  Then you will get
  another flag.  Return this flag to the bridge fortress over the moat.
