* Files included in this archive *
flib10b.bsp             : Map file. (see below for instructions)
flib10b.txt             : The text file you are reading now :)

* Game play *
This is a standard 2 team, 2 flag TeamFortress CTF level.
Each team must defend their flag and attack the enemy team and steal their flag. 
Once the enemy's flag is placed on the flag drop square (it is labled, you can't
miss it!) then the capturing team gets 10 points and all team members get 10 frags.

* Things you need to know about this map *
Nothing much really. I have put a couple of signs in the level to show the flag drop off
point and a direction to take from the spawn room. There is a waterway connecting tunnel
that links the outside area with the main ramp room in each base.

* Map History *
I thought that before I designed a map for Quake2 using the new Worldcraft 1.6 that I
would design a quick map for normal Quake Team Fortress. I tried to get down on paper
some ideas, but drawing in 3d is a real pain sometimes to I just played with Worldcraft
for a while. The map probably took about 10 hours total on and off. I added a few little
touches each time I thought that it was finished. I was going to limit the class selection
on this map, but thought that might piss too many people off so I left it as standard.
The main idea for this map was to keep it ALOT smaller than my other maps. Hopefully this
one might get played on the odd server out there! (yeah, right, 10th time lucky perhaps?)

* Next map *
Perhaps a Quake2 CTF map. Until TF2 comes out, I will design for CTF.
ETA? Not sure, Next month or two if I can keep away from Ultima Online
(If you see Lord Maroc on Atlantic then say Hi).

* My Other Maps *
flibtech   : 2 Teams, 2 flag, standard CTF level. Pretty large (most of my maps tend to
           : get that way, I get carried away ;)
flibcas2   : Fixed version of flibcast with quite a few extra changes and redesign
             of the rooms adjoining the flag room. (Chris ya git!)
flibcast   : Original v1.0 flibcast map
2evil1f    : 2 Teams, 1 flag
             The single flag starts mid-way between both bases and each team
             must get the flag into their own flag room and defend it. The
             longer it is in their flag room, the more points and frags their
             team gets. The other team must capture this flag and place it in
             their flag room.
2evil2f    : Standard 2 Team, 2 flag CTF map.
             same layout as 2evil1f (see above) but for normal CTF rules.
hexTF      : 2 Team, 1 flag idea. Get the flag from the middle into the ENEMYs
             base to get the points. I personally don't like this idea now,
             but let me know if you do :)
massivTF   : My third map and first (released anyway) using the way-cool
             editor Worldcraft. This map is huge, I encountered the Quake map
             limits whilst designing this map. 2 large bases seperated by an
             outside area with extensive waterways going into each base.
mbase_tf   : A 2 team TF map with 2 identical bases seperated by a large body
             of water. One of the first TF maps to use coloured textures to
             identfy the base that you are in.
tf_attdef  : My first map ever! (and it shows :)
             A TF map designed for attack and defend with 2 teams
