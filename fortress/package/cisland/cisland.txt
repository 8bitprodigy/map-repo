======================= Game Play ======================== 

This map (in my opinion) kicks ass
basicaly what u do is u run like hell from ur side of the island to the centeral
tower and grab the flag and bring it back (not easy)

I'm proud of my ladder so don't dis it!
I hope u have a fun time with this map because it was a bitch to create
(error city)
