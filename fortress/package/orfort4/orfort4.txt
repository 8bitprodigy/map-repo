Description: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This was a learning map for me, it's my first map so gimme a little 
slack had to learn all about entities and basic map making myself.  Ented 
helped with the entities, and qoole is a user friendly program so it was not
that difficult.  It is setup like 2fort*, 2 bases 2 teams 2 flags 2 goals.
The map is very basic no doors, just force fields.  

How to use this map:

Unpack orfort4.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory. Unpack orball.mdl
and tf_stan.mdl in your quake\fortress\progs directory. 

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the sk_forts.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory and copy gren1.bsp into your
quake\fortress\progs directory.
