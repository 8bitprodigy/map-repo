* Background *

The local council has arranged a chicken race, the owner
of the fastest chicken gets a 1000$ check.
You have been checking the other opponents progress, and
conclu'ded that the only threat to your victory is that
neighbor farmer across the cornfield.
But you have a plan. Sneak in at night get their key to
the celler where they keep their chicken, kidnap it and
finally kill it. That would give you the victory for sure!
God luck.
