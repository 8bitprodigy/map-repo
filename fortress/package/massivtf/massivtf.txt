* Map Details *
This map is big, really big. There are two bases linked via an outside area
with waterways going into various buildings. It is a standard two-flag game
with both base layouts the same. The flag is on a column surrounded by lava.
The ramp button needs shooting to deploy the ramp to exit the column. The
ramp is also activated by the enemy entering the flag room.
There is only one secret passageway per base, but thats easy enough to find
(hint: find the wall tile that sticks out too far).

If you like this map, email the server operator to tell him. Any comments,
ideas for other maps, etc. can be sent to mark@barney.dungeon.com
Enjoy!

* Other Info *
This level was started just as Quakeworld went 32 players, and the call for
32 player maps for Team Fortress went out. I was designing for about 2 weeks
then ran out of ideas so I left it for a couple of months. Recently I thought
it was about time to release another map or two, so before starting another
map I thought I'd finish this one. After a couple of LAN games to test it
(8 to 10 players) It wad ready to release.

How to use this map:
Copy the hexTF.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map hextf" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the hextf.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory or your quake\fortress\maps dir.
