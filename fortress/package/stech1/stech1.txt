Big thanx to Cocker [FIRE] for help, with out him I don`t think that i had made it all tha way. :)
Thx Cocker!

Just take the other teams flag and bring it back to your base, place it on the q2 button in the floor
in the ramp room.

At the elevator there is a thing that looks like a BIG dispener, if a engineer hit that one with his
spanner, the bars from the roof next to him comes down, go for catching scouts!
I added this function just for that i think that the TF Engineer has to littel to do som thimes. :)

At the other dispenser in the big ramproom you will get the very littel seen Kevlar Armour.
If you are for exampel a Demoman and want to keep your Blast Armour, DONT get it... 
But it is good for sniper and other classes that does not get a specifed armour when they begins.

At the water entrance, there is bars to, just but a littel detpack there and the thing will be 
solved.. ;)
And just shot the other bars in the base.. they will go away then.

This is my first map that i have made to the finish line, so dont get to upset if u find "errors".
But as i wrote, I have not found any yet.

If your find any of your textures in this, dont get mad about it, im just using it because they are
nice. And some of u my easy find constructions from other maps in it, but that is just because
maps like 2fort5, rock1, rock2 and so on are good.. just tried to but toghter a combination.
hope that u like it.

A tip to you that are thinking of making maps, do NOT do a TF map on a P166/32MB Ram... that sucked..
Boy, i need a new computer..

HEHE.. cya SloW Man.
