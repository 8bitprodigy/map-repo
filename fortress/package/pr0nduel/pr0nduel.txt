======================= Game Play ======================== 

  This was the first map I've ever completed. I try a lot, but all of my maps
end up having errors and shit. So all this is, is two bases. Red and Blue. It's a duel.
You fight the other guy. (like square1)

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and 
my friends and clan for not making fun of me when they saw it. :) Thanks also
to the maker of square1 .. which gave me the inspiration. (not like square1 is very
complicated or anything.. but neither is mine. but at least my architecture is 
a tad better)
