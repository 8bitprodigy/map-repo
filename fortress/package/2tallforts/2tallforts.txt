Base                    This is a small map I kicked out while I was fixing my first 2 maps.
                        I originally used this map for my learning process to correct problems
                        on the other 2. I prematurley released one of the other maps,but I hope
                        no one uses it because it was crudely prepared.I will be re-releasing
                        the map called hcamp corrected.I am not going to release any more tall
                        maps after these because of the viewing grey that comes with too much
                        visual height.Look for 2 more maps to follow this one very soon.

Description: 
                    This is similar to all the rest. you have two forts opposite each
                    other, with a pretty mean snipage setup on the roofs. 
                    I believe in face up confrontation, so get prepared.
                      Steal their flag and head for your fort's basement. There you will
                     find a tunnel, that will lead you to the elevator the scoring point
                    is on the cliff next to your fort,where all the snipage will be going
                    on. There is backpacks abounding , some with ammo , some with armor
                    and some with some of everything including both grenade types and detpacks!
                    Some backpacks can be used by both team and some cannot. Health is scattered
                    around. and the respawns lower are team_no setups to protect us grownups
                    from the cheap kill.I even added some art:)
                    This map is freeware. Enjoy it and remember if you don't like the map
                     It is not the end of the world.
          
Installation:      Well! you ought to know by now------fortress/maps=bsp file
                                                       fortress/sound=wav
                                                       and I think the flg.mdl's are just fine
                                                       so I haven't added any, but if I do in the 
                                                       future then it would be:
                                                       fortress/progs=mdl's
                    NOW GET OUT THERE AND KILL SOMETHING IN A TEAM SPIRIT!
