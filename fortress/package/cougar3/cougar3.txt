This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag" map.

There are 2 teams to this map. Red goes for the Blue Flag, Blue goes for the Red one.  Flags are located in the back of the 
opposing teams base at the top of the spiral.  To cap the flag take it to the top of the buttress on your teams front wall.

POINT SYSTEM:
Flags are the standard 10 pts.
Gib the enemy +1frag
Gib yourself -1frag and the shame you must carry with you the rest of your life (unless your a demoman where people are
surprised if you DON'T frag yourself.)
