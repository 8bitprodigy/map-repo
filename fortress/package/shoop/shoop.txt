Gameplay: Capture the enemy flag. A lot.
          Go wheeeee in the air chutes (shoops)
          There are no secrets, no quads, just 2 flags,
          some air chutes, and a few places I used low
          power force fields to keep the enemy out.

If the map seems a bit laggy because of its open style,
then tell me. I kept the brushes to a minimum of 500 and
focused just on gameplay, not fancy stuff. I could probably
pare it down a bit more and close off some of the visibility
from inside either base to the outside area.
I can't tell, my connection owns now. And its free!
