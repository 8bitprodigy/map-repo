Installation:
        This archive contains 3 files.
	-sniprzon.txt	That's this file... doh.
	-sniprzon.bsp	The map file.  Put it in \Quake\Fortress\Maps
                        (you've done this before,... right?)
GamePlay:
        Infiltrate Enemy Stronghold, steal their Key and activate the
        Team Cloaking Device located below the bridge.

Release Notes:
        The Sniper, like all TeamFortress classes, is first and foremost a
soldier. Shooting gallery style plinking is fine and dandy for target practice,
but *Sniping* is about dropping your target dead without being seen, about
waiting in the mud for days to take one shot, about the terror of being shot
at and not knowing where its coming from, about years of analyzing Zapruder
home movies.
        The Sniper must often work alone,relying only on his wits to ensure
his survival. Getting into and out of the Area of Operations without support
requires stealth, cunning and slippery speed or at least a willingness to
fix bayonets and charge in Smokin'!

Hints:
        Beware AutoAim & AutoZoom... It can help, but more likely hinder...
Just remember: shoot between the eyes...
