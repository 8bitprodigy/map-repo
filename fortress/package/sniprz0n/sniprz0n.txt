Installation:
        This archive contains 3 files.
	-sniprz0n.txt	That's this file... doh.
	-sniprz0n.bsp	The map file.  Put it in \Quake\Fortress\Maps
                        (you've done this before,... right?)
GamePlay:
      ->Infiltrate Enemy Stronghold, steal their Key, shoot the drain
	cover under the bridge to gain access to the Cloak Room, swim 
	down and hit the Red Flashing Q to activate the Team Cloaking 
	Device and gain 5 Frags.
      ->Red Flashing Jumpads take you to the second and third stories,
	with ramps up to the Key Room.  
      ->The Elevator Tube to the left of respawn room gains roof access, 
	and has a high dive into a water glass =) to get back down safely...
      ->The CamoFlaged FoxHoles have grenade sumps built into them, 
	so if you're lucky you can dodge the blasts of grenades tossed 
	in after you...

Release Notes:
        The Sniper, like all TeamFortress classes, is first and foremost a
soldier. Shooting gallery style plinking is fine and dandy for target practice,
but *Sniping* is about dropping your target dead without being seen, about
waiting in the mud for days to take a single shot, about the terror of being
shot at and not knowing where its coming from, about grassy knolls and years of 
analyzing Zapruder home movies...
        The Sniper must often work alone,relying only on his wits to ensure
his survival. Getting into and out of the Area of Operations without support
requires stealth, cunning and slippery speed or at least a willingness to
fix bayonets and charge in Smokin'!

Hints:
        Beware AutoAim & AutoZoom... They can help, but more likely hinder...
Just remember: shoot between the eyes...
