Description             :  Good Ol' Army v1.2 18th of May 1998
                           ===================================
                           You are red/blue. Get the blue/red flag from
                          your opposing team and capture it by bringing
                          the flag to your platform in your HQ's 2nd
                          floor, while trying to stop the other team
                          from doing the same thing to your flag. In
                          other words: It's kinda like those
                          2fort4-clones you've been playing for a
                          looooooooong time. :)
                          
                           Things you should know:
                           =======================
                           - Mortar: Yeah, toss those mIRV's sky-high!
                          Just let the engineer whack his spanner
                          awhile... Oh, and you can close the opposing
                          teams mortar by utilising the spanner. ;)
                          
                           - There are two respawn rooms: in the 1st
                          floor of the HQ and one behind the fort.
                          
                          - The two towers in each fort contains not
                          only a platform for snipers to snipe, but
                          also a sniperhole. Which is IMHO much safer
                          than on the top.. :)

                           History
                           =======
                          v1.0 - The very first.
                          
                          v1.1 - Had to decrease the detail level to a
                          somewhat lower state.
                          
                          v1.2 - Ouch. One of the giant rocks had a
                          invisible gap. Fixed it.
                          
                           Misc.
                           =====
                           If you add this map to your server, then let
                          me know about it.
                          
                           Thanks goes to 'Commander Michl' for the
                          suggestions and advice. And to 'Dyer Keeper'
                          for her great RealAudio-show 'Blueprint
                          mints', whose advices definitely made me
                          aware of those damned polys.
                           Also, the 'Yh.wav' was borrowed from
                          border1, though I don't think the author
                          minds at all. Thanks for him anyway. :)

Comments                : This has definitely been a learning
                          experience when I've been making this map. I
                          thought I'd do this in a couple of days.
                          Well, I was wrong. It took a week and a half
                          to somewhat complete this, all while trying
                          hard to reduce those damn polys from the map. 
                          
                           Well, what's still left to do? Er...
                           - Polys: in some points over 500 polys
                          (Sometimes 1000!). 'Never again,' I hear
                          myself say. 'Never again will I do another
                          two forts in one outdoorish style!'
                          
                           - Larger playarea: Yeah, right. I wanna do
                          something else for a change.
