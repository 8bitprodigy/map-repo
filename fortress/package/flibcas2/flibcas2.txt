                        : Id, The guys at TeamFortress, Raistlin for Ented,
                        : My bastard cousin Chris for suggesting the extra rooms

* Game play *
This is a standard 2 team, 2 flag TeamFortress CTF level.
Each team must defend their flag and attack the enemy team and steal their
flag. Once the enemy's flag is placed in the circle on the floor of the flag
room then the capturing team gets 10 points and all team members get 10 frags.

* Map History *
I was bored one saturday recently so I decided to knock up a map in an
afternoon to play in a LAN session for 8 players the next day. This map was
the result of about 6/7 hours with Worldcraft. It isn't very pretty but it
plays quite well for up to about 16 players. It might be a bit hectic for
32 players, I don't know. please let me know what you think.
v2.0 was released about 2 weeks later after I found out about the server crash
problem from Proxy (thanks again mate).

* My Other Maps *
flibcast   : Original v1.0 flibcast map
2evil1f    : 2 Teams, 1 flag
             The single flag starts mid-way between both bases and each team
             must get the flag into their own flag room and defend it. The
             longer it is in their flag room, the more points and frags their
             team gets. The other team must capture this flag and place it in
             their flag room.
2evil2f    : Standard 2 Team, 2 flag CTF map.
             same layout as 2evil1f (see above) but for normal CTF rules.
hexTF      : 2 Team, 1 flag idea. Get the flag from the middle into the ENEMYs
             base to get the points. I personally don't like this idea now,
             but let me know if you do :)
massivTF   : My third map and first (released anyway) using the way-cool
             editor Worldcraft. This map is huge, I encountered the Quake map
             limits whilst designing this map. 2 large bases seperated by an
             outside area with extensive waterways going into each base.
mbase_tf   : A 2 team TF map with 2 identical bases seperated by a large body
             of water. One of the first TF maps to use coloured textures to
             identfy the base that you are in.
tf_attdef  : My first map ever! (and it shows :)
             A TF map designed for attack and defend with 2 teams
