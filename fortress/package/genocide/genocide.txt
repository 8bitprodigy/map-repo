===============================G3noc1de By [Pi]Carnage-OSA-J==============================
					Update Version
Map Specifications:

-Built with Qoole
-Build time was 2 days
-Type is a 1v1 or 2v2 style 2 team map


For those that had my previous version, g_cide1 know that it was obsolete =] So I completely 
remade the entire thing from scratch and redid all the design. What differs from the 1st one 
in this one is that its bigger, added a second way to get out of your base, resupplies are
better, respawn rooms are bigger, better texturing, the hills are better, and I added side 
ledges like the ones in sq1 except mine dont go all the way around. So as you can read, its 
majorly different.
