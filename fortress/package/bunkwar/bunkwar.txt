Description             : TF map roughly based on 2forts, consisting of
			  two bunkers. Flag capture is semi-ctf, you have
			  capture at your team's flag, but your flag does
			  not have to be present. The lights in either
			  bunker can be switched off in the generator
			  room downstairs.
