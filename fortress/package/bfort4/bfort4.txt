***This map designed for the TeamFortress v2.6 quakeC mod***
=======================-> Release Notes
This will be the last version you see from me for abit!
If you see anything it maybe a new map! (or any fixes for this map!)
I wanted to get to this point that i'm really happy with BFort
I think Teamplay should go ALOT smoother in this version.

I took out a slide for getting out of the water (2nd bridge) by the base,
this makes it so they must cross the bridge!
A new Tunnel too & from the ramproom! that alone will make the ramproom
play much more fun =) Also acouple new textures, & some other stuff..

=======================-> Map Information

Title: BaseFort4
Filename: BFort4.zip

Description; Both sides have a Base & a Fort (BaseFort)
* The 'base' has your teams respawns/flag/cap_point inside.
* The rest of your teams side is called the 'fort'
The ramproom/frontdoor/snipernest/waterramps, are all used for killing
your enemy as they TRY & make it to your base!

Flag stuff; find your way into the other teamz fort,
go across the bridge, enter the base. Take their flag,
cap your enemies flag at the front of your BasE (note: NOT 'fort')
10 frags! Not hard? =)
