* Revison History *

24/10/97 emp1.bsp released
There was problems with clients crashing when entering the reactor room from outside.
I have removed 32 ents from the map and 20 that are visiable from the problem areas
This should fix this problem.

* The Story So Far *

Mission Briefing..

There once was a joint research project between two governments to develop an E.M.P 
(Electro Magnetic Pulse) weapon but the relationship between these two countries has 
broken down and they are now fighting for sole control of the research complex.

When the complex was set up one of the major worries was that this situation might arise,
so two reactors were built, one in each of the government's bases.

The plutonium required to charge the reactors was refined into two types Red Pluto 
and Blue Pluto, and then stored in the other government's complex. i.e. Red Pluto is in 
the Blue Base and the Blue Pluto is in the Red base. This was done so the generator could
only be fired with both government's permission.

You and your assault team are charged with the responsibility to destroy as many enemy 
troops as possible by using conventional assault techniques and by utilizing the E.M.P 
generator as a weapon of mass destruction...

The primary objective of your assault force team is to capture enough plutonium to charge
your reactor to 100% and then trigger it to cause some serious damage to the enemy...

Your secondary objective is to seek out and destroy any enemy that are found and provide
cover support for your team members that are trying to return a Pluto rod to your reactor.

If you are killed the Pluto rod is exposed to the air and disintegrates, another one is 
generated to replace the one that has been lost.. (i.e. you don't drop the item when you 
die, it's lost. Thus you must survive one full run to capture a rod)..

Each time the E.M.P. generator is started it drains all the power from your reactor and 
so it has to be recharged.

Good Luck...

* Game Play *

Each side has 5 Pluto Rods. 
2 * 10% charge - easy to get near the front of the enemy complex 
2 * 30% charge - harder, must go a bit further in to enemy complex 
1 * 50% charge - at the far back of the enemy complex 
The rods are regenerated when processed or dropped, back to where they came from. 
You can carry more they one rod at a time,and one reactor where you place the captured
rods... 
Stand on the platform at the back of the reactor. The reactor takes 10 seconds to process
each rod. Once the reactor is at 100% it will still accept the rods but will just discard
them i.e. the team will not get any more points until the reactor is discharged by firing 
the EMP generator.
The reactor charge level is shown on the back wall of the reactor room and on the front of
your base. 
The switches at the back of the base open a door to the second floor above. 
One door can be jumped to from the top of the boxes and the other one is by the upper 
level 30% rod. 
In the upper room is Rockets so you can stock up on grenades. 
The Red Armor is Blast Armor.
