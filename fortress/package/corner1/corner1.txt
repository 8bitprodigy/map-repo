**** Game Play ****

The map is designed for two teams. Each team has a flag. Between the two sides
there is a separate area where the flag is to be captured. The goal is to obtain the 
other teams flag and take it to the capture point while preventing your opponent 
from doing the same to you.

**** Scoring ****

Capturing the flag gives the flag carrier five frags and gives all members of the 
team ten frags (15 total for the flag carrier). The team is also 'scored' ten points
towards the team score. This gives the flag runner a little more ranking potential 
and still works well with pure team score.

When the enemy flag is captured, all players on the team are upgraded to full health,
armor, ammo and grenades. Enjoy it, you've earned it.

While the opponent has your flag or your flag is away from the lower flag room, a 
secondary passage to the capture point is enabled through a concealed door. This door
can be reached from the base via a hallway from the water room. The door only opens
when your flag is not at the original location.
