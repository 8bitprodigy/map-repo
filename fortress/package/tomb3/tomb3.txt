======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag" map.

There are two teams to play on, each with their own flags. However, once the opposing teams flag is captured, you must take it to the TOMB in the centre of the map. If you have the key, you will hear a chant and be able to open the sarcophagus in the centre of the room. Drop down the shaft and sacrifice yourself to the gods. Easy.

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress and id software for Quake

Special thanks go once a again to Edge for putting up with my relentless questions, and to Slagpuppy, Ewarwoowoo [TF] Torquemada and Ringo for play testing, suggestions and advice. I couldn't have done it without you lads.

Finaly a beeeeg thankyou to the TF console at clan Erinyes, Its a mega site, I think I spent half the contruction time for this map browsing thier site.

I have made extensive use of the textures used by Rogue software. If anyone has a problem with this please let me know and I will remove the map from my site and put out a message to all ftp sites holding this map.
