* Files included in this archive *
flibtech.bsp            : Map file. (see below for instructions)
flibtech.txt            : The text file you are reading now :)

* Game play *
This is a standard 2 team, 2 flag TeamFortress CTF level.
Each team must defend their flag and attack the enemy team and steal their
flag. Once the enemy's flag is walked through the teleporter doorway in the
flag room then the capturing team gets 10 points and all team members 
get 10 frags.

* Things you need to know about this map *
At the exit door from the spawn rooms there are special recharge strips suspended
either side of the door. Simply walk through these to get recharged with ammo/health.
There is also a broken-down version of the recharger at the base of the middle
column in the ramp room connecting to the courtyard.
Next to each of the spawn rooms there is a teleporter room. In this room there
are 3 seperate teleporter machines. On activation of a button in front of each
the door to the teleporter will open allowing the use of the teleporter. After
a couple of seconds the door will close and the teleporter will be out of action
until the button in front is reset (about 10 seconds or so). The teleporters are
one-way only so theres no jumping back to the spawn room for pickups.
Outside in the water between bases, there is a water tunnel leading to each base.
The tunnel is blocked by a metal grill which needs to be blown up by a demoguy/gal
using the detpack.

* Map History *
Erm, liked the idea of the courtyard in rock1 so I started with that idea and
then designed the rest of the map from there. I actually sketched some ideas
down for this one (shock horror) 8-)

* My Other Maps *
flibcas2   : Fixed version of flibcast with quite a few extra changes and redesign
             of the rooms adjoining the flag room. (Chris ya git!)
flibcast   : Original v1.0 flibcast map
2evil1f    : 2 Teams, 1 flag
             The single flag starts mid-way between both bases and each team
             must get the flag into their own flag room and defend it. The
             longer it is in their flag room, the more points and frags their
             team gets. The other team must capture this flag and place it in
             their flag room.
2evil2f    : Standard 2 Team, 2 flag CTF map.
             same layout as 2evil1f (see above) but for normal CTF rules.
hexTF      : 2 Team, 1 flag idea. Get the flag from the middle into the ENEMYs
             base to get the points. I personally don't like this idea now,
             but let me know if you do :)
massivTF   : My third map and first (released anyway) using the way-cool
             editor Worldcraft. This map is huge, I encountered the Quake map
             limits whilst designing this map. 2 large bases seperated by an
             outside area with extensive waterways going into each base.
mbase_tf   : A 2 team TF map with 2 identical bases seperated by a large body
             of water. One of the first TF maps to use coloured textures to
             identfy the base that you are in.
tf_attdef  : My first map ever! (and it shows :)
             A TF map designed for attack and defend with 2 teams
