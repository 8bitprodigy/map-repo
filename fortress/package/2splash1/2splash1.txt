======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag" map.

There are two teams to play on, the usual info applies. The flag position is at the front of the oppositions fort, behind the sniper deck. The drop off, or capture point is at the rear of the top level, a doorway is marked with the captured key colour. To make a capture, proceed up the long ramp to the hole in the floor at the top, and drop throught the hole. Its as easy as that!
