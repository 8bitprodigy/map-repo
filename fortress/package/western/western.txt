* Other Info *

  This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own base,
at opposite ends of the map.

  The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
flag which is in their courtyard. The flag must then be returned to the
upper walkway of their home fort.

  There are resupply points in the main bunker of each fort.

  The frag count of each player should be their team scores.

N.B. The grappling hook has been removed in this level.
