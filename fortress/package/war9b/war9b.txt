======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Slaughter Fest" map.

This is a Large Two Forts style map with a Mega Team Resupply, in the middle of the Dock. No flag caps in this map just 
control the dispenser in the middle and kill off the poorly supplied enemies. each fort has a resupply which will give out
a drop of ammo. There is a Quad on top of each fort and a RED armor in the top middle wooden section, which is reachable 
via lifts or grapple if grapple is allowed by admin. 

POINT SYSTEM: Just kills no Caps
 

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and all the guys that shoot me on the company 
network during lunch, without whom I would have no reason to make maps like this. Thanks Tim, Kevin O, Manny, Kevin C.,
Barry, Dave and Brian O'. If you do not like this map let me know what sucks about it so I don't make the same mistakes
again.
