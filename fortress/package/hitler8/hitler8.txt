======================= Game Play ======================== 

[Jeff C] When I downloaded hitler7 I saw a great small map with bad ents. I gave this map 
new ents that give it something most other maps do not have, a story. The two sides are the
American Liberalists in blue vs. the Soviet Communists in red of course. Setting is Berlin 1945.
Both sides are competing to kill the seemingly invincible Hitler. Hence only a spy can do the job.
Offense needs at least one spy to steal the opposing team's spy tools kit, who then uses the tools
on Hitler in the central fortress. Doing so gets 10 points, but Hitler survives/escapes while German
snipers appear and kill you :} So the map does not end after one cap like engbat.

POINT SYSTEM:
Spy uses opposing country's spy kit to get to Hitler: 10 points
 

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and all the guys that shoot me on the company 
network during lunch, without whom I would have no reason to make maps like this. Thanks Tim, Kevin O, Manny, Kevin C.,
Barry, Dave & Brian.
