To install simply put all 3 bsps in the fortress/maps directory

If you do run this map on a server please make sure that the ppl
who get the level know that this is a beta and are prepared to face
another 1 meg download.
The good news is that this is pretty much 99% there.  The red flag
(uh fort :) needs to be rotated, the rock texture in the upper area
ceiling needs to be changed and the lighting effect outside added
And thats it :)
sw33t!

Oh congrats go to lardy (timefly[iC]) for getting the first ever cap
on 2fortse.....  as a hwguy >:)  NUTTA!!!!!!!
