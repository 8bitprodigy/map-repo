* Game play *Ok, listen up cuz this is a bit complic8ted. It starts out with team 1 in a base and Team
2 in a cave with no ammo except detpacks and medkits. Team 2 has to get the Fusion Cell,
the Pheonix Gate, and the Rune into the base's Tech Unit. When they accomplish this, the
spawnpoints switch and Team 1 gets the cave and Team 2 gets the base. 

Some Stuff

How to get the Fusion Cell: 
Enter the base as a demoman through the front door and turn left then right.Jump into the lava and then quickly jump onto the lower ledge. Lay a detpack
there. If you wanna escape, jump in the middle of the lava and a column will
take you out. When the detpack goes off, go back and get the Fusion Cell.

The head-chopper-offer also opens and closes the rock trap.

If you jump off the ledge on the roof, there is a 1/8 chance of getting in the base.

The Brains and Quader give armor.

The cave team can take the base team's supply backpacks.

I might update this map.
