* File Info *************************

	There are Six (6) files in the zip

Put these into your fortress\maps
	- xcalibr2.txt   (this text file)
	- xcalibr2.bsp

These wav files go in fortress\sound\items
        - cbd-armr.wav   I dunno who made this, but I caught it floating
			 around on undernet (#wavs'r'us) It's great!
	- swrdpull.wav   Self made

These files go in your fortress\progs
	- myr_stan.mdl   Myriad ISP's Quake standard, and it fits Xcaliber's
			 theme better than a normal flag.
	- crystal.mdl	 This is from Dyermaker's Iceland (thnx DM!)

* Game Play **************************

The object of this map is to get the enemies banner and return it to your
main room on the upper deck. What I really wanted to do is redo the entire
bottleneck layout of most 2fort4 type maps. I count no less than 5 ways into
the enemy fort, 4 ways to the banner (2, maybe 4 ways out) and so with all of
these ways, I made the Main Royal Hall a very elegant bottleneck in itself.
I have no idea what defense will do, but I see this room as IT.

Oh, and I had fun setting up the front gates (doors) to where they do open
for their own team from the outside (both teams from the inside) and can also
be detpacked by the other team.

Again, I always loved elaborate architecture when making maps for Doom2 and
of course Quake let me do so much more.
I did run into brush limits on this one so I had to del a lot of what I had
(bsp time 4 freaking hours! Didn't even attempt to vis that puppy) and I hope
everone likes my lighting (I almost called the map Twilight. I never name a
map until I'm done with it)

Of course the grappling hook is disabled in this map. Map is NOT designed for it!
(Only map I've seen the grapple work well in is The Street)

* Version 2 Reference *******************

1.  Fixed various textures
2.  Redid the upper respawn area to make it more roomy
3.  Light, light, light!
4.  Added some water boulders to break up some lines
5.  Cut some detail from main room, but looks better!
6.  Fixed the camera
7.  Added the cool startup screen ala Dyermaker & Midori
	I hope everyone's seen Midori's BAM4 ending screen, but check out
	 Dyermaker's startup screen for Iceland3! It rocks!
8.  Fixed the respawn door that would open thru a thin wall beside it.
9.  Fixed the camera (dammit, Qoole won't save my mangle values!)
10. Did work on the bridge
11. Changed the flags to banners
12. Added flaginfo status
13. Fixed some blue respawn angles

14. Added the Xcaliber and its attendant chamber.
		This item is simply a dressed up quad/invulnerablity available
		only when a player has grabbed the enemy banner, and then pro-
		ceeded to the rafters in the enemy fort and obtained Merlin's
		crystal nested there.
		After aquiring the crystal, the player then takes flight to the
		underwater area and is able to pull xcaliber from the stone!

       notes:   The crystal may only be obtained after aquiring the enemy banner. 
		This will definitely be harder with the more players there are,
		and it will not be an easy task getting to the top deck, and then
		to the rafters. So I foresee mainly soldiers getting the crystal.
		Or maybe those proficient gren jumpers like me! But be aware that
		to get the crystal, you have to go thru the fort, grab the banner,
		make your way back thru the fort, jump to the upper deck, and
		then jump to the rafters. You will pretty much have to make it
		thru with no damamge to get it...but what a treat if you do!
		Xcaliber lasts 40 seconds.
		I loved making the Sword and Stone, hope everyone likes it!
