	This is a 2 team capture-the-flag style map.  Team 1 and team 2 
have their own base, at opposite ends of the map.

	The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, take the enemy key 
which is in their basement. The key must then be taken to the pad on your
upper deck.  After you walk on the pad you are teleported to a room where
there are many buttons on the floor.  Stepping on one of the buttons activates
a backpack bonus.  The bonuses give you more of whatever button you stepped on.
For example, stepping on the health adds more health to the backpack. Scores
for capping are like this.  The team receives 10 frags and the person who 
captured gets an extra 2 frags.
	
	The backpack bonuses are as follows: Shells, Cells, Rockets, Nails,
Armor, Grenades, Health, Special.  All the above are self explanatory, they 
give you extra stuff in the backpack.  Now the Special gives you a few seconds
of Invunerability and Quad dammage, Plus it gives you a few extra seconds of
Invisibility.

	NOTE: There is 1 secret in this map (mabye more, I'm not telling)
Anyway, there is the "Mega Charge" It give you a few seconds of Invunerability, 
Invisibility, and Quad dammage.  This allows you to blaze through the enemy base
without worry of attackers.

*Neat Things*

When a team caps, their flag room fills with water.
When outside a base while carring a flag, everyone knows your general location.


	If you notice any problems or major things that need to be changed, feel 
free to email me (blog@hotmail.com) also if you like the level or just want
to know how I did anything, I will be glad to tell.
