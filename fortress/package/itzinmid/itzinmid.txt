Title			:It's In The Center

Description		Basic Layout: I started making this map trying
			to make a new voting level but it started to
			change into a playable Team Fortress level.
			The center of the map is sort of like the center
			of Spaz-ball and the bases are like the bases in
			Steal4d. I tried to do all the flag re-spawn stuff
			my self, to no avail. So I had a look at how it's
			done in steal4d and did the same as that.
			There is four different spawn points in each base.
			
			Aim: The aim of this map is to get the flag from
			the center and hold onto it as long as you can,
			while the other teams gang up and try to wipe you
			OUT! If you have the flag and you are killed, the
			flag will go back to the centre for someone else
			to grab. Every 20 seconds the team with the flag 
			will get 2 frags.

* Hints *

			1. In the center there is a door which goes up when the
			flag is taken and comes down when the flag returns.
			There is a button in each base (in the re-spawn area)
			which toggles the center door, so if the door get's out
			of sync you can fix it up. The door gets stuffed if some-
			one get's squashed, so look to see if someone gets killed
			by the center door so you know when to hit the button. 

			2. If you have the flag and you want a place to hide you
			can either, go to your base and get up onto the shelf
			where you spawn and hide there (because grens can't reach
			the back of the ledge), but it's hard to get up there for
			some people. OR if their is a team with no members in it
			you can hide in there base. :)

			3. Up the top of the center door there is a trigger_hurt
			which gives 300 damage, so you don't get flag campers up 
			their. (I hate flag campers!)  

* Installation *

			Place the itzinmid.bsp in you fortress maps directory
			eg. C:\games\quake\fortress\maps
			Place this text file (itzinmid.txt) with the rest of your
			other text files.
			Place the new sound (shell2.wav) in your sounds - weapons
			directory. eg. C:\games\quake\fortress\sounds\weapons
			Then have fun playing. :)

* Thanks To *

			Thanks to the people who made worldcraft, quake, qwsv.
			A special thanks to krypt who play tested the map with
			me and helped fix some problems with it.

			ssion. Thank you
