======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map.

There are 2 teams to this map. Blue and Red.  Blue and Red fight eachother
to capture the enemy flag. Blue and Red's bases are quasi identical.
Each team has a Flag. You will find the flag in the enemy base on the firstfloor 
behind some hurtles. Bring this flag to the colored stone in the dark corner next 
to your Snipernest in your base.
You can blow up the grate in the well with a detpack.
And yes, there is a secret door somewhere in each base. You can open it with a detpack.


POINT SYSTEM:

	10 Frags are awarded for the flag capturing team
	1 Bonus-Frag is awarded to the player who captured the flag.
