* Other Info *

This is a two team war simulation. Each team has its own Stargate and team color which corresponds to the color of the fort that they will be defending against the other Stargate platoon.

You start off in your own Stargate. Walk thru the portal and you will go to your fort in another dimension. Defend your fort against invading troops intent on capturing your base flag which is located in the basement.

If you are fortunate to survive stealing the enemy flag from their basement, carry it back to your basement resupply room. You will see another door there, go thru it. You will then see a large teleporter that engulfts the rear wall. Go thru it to return to your Stargate. Climb the stairs and on the platform you will see a block which has your team colors on it. Step onto this and you will have officially captured their flag and points and frags will be awarded to you and your team.

You will notice that this world is rather dark. This is because the planet revolves around a dwarf star. Darkness can be a help and a hinder. Inside each fort is a main elevator which has a small doorway cut into its rear wall. Somewhere within the following room is a switch that will turn on powerful spotlights to completely illuminate your base! This can be bad news for you but good news to the invaders. Protect this switch from being activated! If it does become activated, it cannot be turned off for 15 seconds! 

There are resupply areas in the basement and top floor. There is also a teleporter in the basement to take you directly to the top floor.

To open the flag gate you must first shoot the yellow wall button that is directly across from the gate.

The team that has the highest points at the end of the time limit (which is set by the server, usually 30 minutes) wins the game.
