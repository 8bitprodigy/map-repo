Details: 
	Svalley4 is the third revision of svalley, my very first Quake map. Since the original version, the map has been completely overhauled: re-textured, re-lighted, and additional areas were added. I made svalley4 because I was never completely happy with the easily defended svalley3. So, i made these changes:

--Outside bridge is wider to allow more dodging capability.
--Hallways inside are widened for maneuverability and to reduce less choke-points.
--The chip (flag) return time is doubled.
--The flag room is moved to a position easier for the enemy to infiltrate, requiring more defensive teamwork. There are two entrances.
--Texturing and detail changes...purely intended for visuals, though I think some creative teams will find strategical value in these as well. 
--Added a water entrance into the base. It is where the inner respawn used to sit. The respawn was moved to where the old flag room was. Thee is a grate that needs to be blown before accessing the water entry.
--Finally, a more comprehensive scoring system. Details follow.

-==SCORING==- 
A) 2 TEAM POINTS are awarded each time the chip is removed from its pedestal (not everytime its touched). 2 FRAGS are given ONLY to the player who removes the flag. 
B) 8 TEAM POINTS are given each time the chip is processed (capped). 10 FRAGS are given to EVERY player on the capping team. NOTE: The player who initally grabbed the flag leading to a cap will receive a total of 12 FRAGS for the process. All others receive 10. 
C) The enemy computer terminal (capping place) may be detpacked for 3 POINTS and 3 FRAGS. This may be done as many times as possible. The computer repairs itself after 10 seconds.
D) Lastly, detonating the grate that blocks the water entry gives 4 points and 4 frags; only possible once. The grate can NOT be repaired.

Refer to my older visions for more detail on layout, etc.
