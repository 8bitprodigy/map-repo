* Description and explanation for -another- 2forts map *

This map was inspired by the number of people who fight one on one
in 2fort4/5.  This is a barebones 2forts map with only a trimmed 
down outdoor area, sniper nests/front entrances, ramp rooms, and 
water entrances.

I've attempted to give each base its own look and feel, but aside 
from different textures, they should be identical.

2fortdm was made with 1-4 vs 1-4 battles in mind.  It contains no
flags, no command points, and lacks innovation.  This is a map to
fight one on one, have a sniper war, or for small practices when
most of your clan forgets to show up. 

Comments and suggestions are welcome.  This was my first map, so
I'm sure that I messed up in a few ways. :)  If you modify this 
map in any way, please let me know, as I'm interested in seeing
how others would have done things.

Have fun. :)
