--= Gameplay Notes =---------------------------------------------------------

Although it looks like a tarted up 2fort5 clone, it plays suprisingly
different to the original, the biggest change is the scale of the map, the
choak areas of old have been enlarged to make it much more 12v12 friendly and
there are also various other measures in place to cut down on spam including
grates and slow gren2 respawns.
