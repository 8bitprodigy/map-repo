Gameplay
============
* Quakers that like to rocket/grenade jump will like the
area around the respawn.  You can boost yourself up there
and camp above the respawn and walk around the roof of the building.

* As being a sniper myself, I tried to make areas that I would like 
to snipe in.  There are two dark towers on the sides of each base and
a larger tower in the front, as well as catwalks around various parts 
of the level.

* The water is a little difficult to get out of.  I find that it is a 
little funny to blast someone into the water who doesn't know how to get
out.  However, u can RJ or Gren jump out.

* There are two ramps coming down into the sewers just behind the respawn
areas.  The ramp paths intersect and follow a series of ramps to a water 
cave.  The demoman can blow the wall that is fairly noticable.  Under the 
island in the middle is an underwater tunnel that can take you under.

* The diamonds are located in a small bunker at the very back of each 
base, as to provide a challenge to get to it.  Once retreived, return to 
the very back of your base where you will see a portal. Jump through and
you will earn your team an extra ten points. 

==================
Extra Information
==================
I am aware that there are portions of the map that will "gray out". The 
complexity of the maps makes it rather difficult for quake to render it
all at once.  In my opinion it disgraces the map somewhat, and unfortunetly
there is nothing I can do without changing the map's structure. 

If you really like my map, tell the server admins.  If you don't, well, 
that's your problem I guess.

Enjoy!
