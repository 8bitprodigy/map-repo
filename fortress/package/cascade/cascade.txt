Description             : This map is made for the
                          Team Fortress Patch. It won't be fun
                          playing it without the patch.

  This is a capture-the-flag map designed for two teams.
  The goal is to capture the flag, that's located in the enemy base.
  Then, you have to return with the flag to your own base, and stand
  on the circle that's on the second flour (You'll find all that stuff out
  when you start playing).
