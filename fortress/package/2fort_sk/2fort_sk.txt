* Construction *

Base                    : Imaginos started off by rebuilding 2fort23.map
                          (BY John Cook) when my 2fortSK was taking too
                          long to VIS (I let it run for 2 days at level 4
                          before I stopped it, then another 1.5 days with
                          just regular VIS...I needed my computer)
                          Most of the stuff from 2fort23.map (BY John Cook)
                          was scrapped and replaced. Then it was handed to 
                          me and I finished it off and did some texturing
                          and lighting. I also designed the resupplies, 
                          which I'll be releasing for Worldcraft pretty 
                          soon. I did all the TF ent stuff.

                          rVIS 1.0

Known Bugs              : None. There was 1 bug reported, and a few small
                          things that people wanted changed which I agreed
                          with. The bug was fixed, changes were made, and
                          this map is now 100% ready for QuakeWorld. Serve 
                          it up, y'all! :)
                        
                          There were bugs reported about respawn points 
                          and players being stuck. I quickly found, after
                          running the map on a QW server, that the problem
                          was because the teamspawn points in the upper red
                          resupply were too close to the ceiling. 
                           --FIXED

                          I also received a few messages about people not
                          liking the elevator from the ramp room to the 
                          basement. I didn't build that elevator, so I just
                          scrapped it and redid it. People should be happier
                          with it now.
                           --FIXED

                          A few areas were deemed too dark. The main was the
                          quicktrip elevator in the blue lobby. You couldn't
                          see it because it was so dark. I put lights in it
                          to match the lights in the red one. Also, I put 
                          lights in the "duck-ins" in the flag rooms.
                           --FIXED

Build Time              : About 2.5 weeks
                   QBSP : <5 minutes
           light -extra : 1084 secs
          rVIS -level 4 : 152 secs

Description: 

Well, I've been working on this one for a while. I love 2fort4.bsp (BY John 
Cook), but it DOES have some problems. Mostly I just didn't like the way it
LOOKED. The textures didn't bring it to life enough for me, so I decided to
build my own version. 

There was no way I was gonna get my hands on 2fort4.map to play with, because
I didn't know Network had it on his page so I could plagarize a LATER version
of John Cook's work instead. The whole point to begin with was I wanted to
build the stuff that was in 2fort4.bsp (by John Cook) myself instead of just 
fixing up 2fort4, which I've already done via a new .ent file (Original ents
by John Cook, I'm pretty sure) So I dug around on my old floppies and found a
copy of tfmaps.zip, which I believe was released to the public domain by TFS, 
there's no text file with it, which contained fastflag.map, 2fort23.map, 
havoc.map, storm1.map and deathx3.map. I set to work retexturing 2fort23.map
immediately, and in a couple of days, with a little reconstruction in some 
places, I had a GOOD looking 2fort23. That wasn't enough...there were no 
elevators from the basement, no direct ramp in the ramp room...lots of little
things missing. I rebuilt EVERYTHING that was missing, including adding in 
the upper respawn from 2fort_32.bsp. (By Network and TyR, based on Two Forts 
by John Cook)

I was finally done. All the entities were working right, the lights looked
good, and the textures were beautiful. Now all I had to do was run:
LIGHT -extra 2fortSK.bsp
VIS -level 4 2fortSK.bsp
...
Sure...right. No problem, right? Wrong. Light took 2 hours. No problem, I'd
expected at LEAST that. VIS on the other hand...I let it run for 7 hours 
before I had to shut down and take my system home. Then I started it again.
It ran another 8 hours before a power outage. Then another 40 minutes before
ANOTHER power outage. Then I got drunk. Early the next morning, I started it
AGAIN. This time, I let it run over 2 days before I finally needed my system
more than I needed this level VIS'd. After I'd updated my website, checked 
all my email, and played a quick couple levels of TF, I started regular VIS
with no -level ANYTHING. I let that run over 36 hours before I finally just
gave up. We had a LAN game and I wasn't cancelling for that. Depression set 
in...

A couple days later, while talking to my dad (SK-Imaginos), he mentioned 
that he'd spent the weekend rebuilding 2for23.map (by John Cook) with big
brushes, so it would compile. I begged him EMAIL IT!! So he did, he had to 
go back to work the next day, so he told me to have my way with it. I loaded
it up and played it. It looked great, so I started looking for problems...I 
found some. 

<shortening of story...hehe>

I fixed the problems, added what was missing, designed a new resupply room
system to cut down on the entity count, and polished it off. Then I compiled
it. Then we played it. :) Now you can play it too!


How to use this map:

Unpack 2fortSK.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory. If you want to run
it on a LAN server or just take a peek at it, load quake with -game fortress
and type MAP 2fortSK in the console to load it. 

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the 2fortSK.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory.
