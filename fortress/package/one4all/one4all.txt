This map is designed for four team fun, but you can also play it
with only two or three teams. 

You must capture the key below and return it to the circle at the
startpoint. You'll get 5 points for capturing the key and 10 points 
for returning it.

* Installation *

Copy the One4All.bsp into your fortress\maps directory.

IMPORTANT:
Creat a directory called sound inside your fortress directory.
Copy all .wav files into the fortress\sound directory.
If you don't do this you'll get an error message every time
one of these sounds is activated.
