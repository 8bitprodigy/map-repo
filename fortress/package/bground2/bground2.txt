bground2	
*	Moved center sewer access pipe to the water.  
*	Added platforms under water next to sewer pipes.
*	Flags were not respawning quickly enough, worked to alleviate this.
*	Flags were eventually vanishing forever, worked to alleviate this.
*	Moved some ammunition points around a little.
* 	Added an "arrow slit" to the center "tower pillbox."
*	Fixed the goofy scoring system.

bground1
*	Initial release.

Simple Game Play:	Take control of the flag stations by running across 
			the touch pads and defend them.  Scoring is based on
			length of time stations are held by a given team.

Detailed Map Info:

There are two fortresses, two outposts and the center area.  The fortresses and 
outposts are assigned a color (The fortresses are obvious, the outpost color depends
upon which fortress it is closest to).  

The Point system works like this:  

1 frag, 1 point (duh).
Hold your fortress for two minutes: 20 team points
Hold your outpost for one minute: 5 team points
Hold the center flag for one minute: 15 team points
Hold the enemy outpost for one minute: 10 team points
Hold the enemy fortress for one minute: 20 team points

There is health available just inside of each fortress.  It heals 20 points of 
damage per second.

There is ammunition available in the fortress courtyard and in the towers.
They add a bit of ammo every second.

There is grenades/detpacks/medpacks available in the backpack in the armory.

There is specialized armor available in the team armory.

There is ammunition available all over the level, these replenish every two seconds

The bottom 2 feet of water is actually lava, don't touch (heh, heh).

The sewer system has 6 entrances (and no lava).

There are no team powerups.

Game Play Notes:

It's pretty important to work in groups.  Protect a given flag station and keep the 
enemy from running over the touch pad (Demomen are very effective for this).  
Another proven tactic is to have a "shock group" set up -- Just run around and 
suicide at the touch plates to screw up enemy scoring.

Keep assaulting the enemy fortress.  You don't actually get to score there very 
often, but it keeps the bad guys busy.  Make a point of running over the touch plate
in your own fortress whenever you respawn.

Remember, there's always another way (except into the fortresses).
