* Gameplay *

Grab the key from the enemy's base and return it to the funky floor object
near your spawnpoint.

Exciting!

This is actually the second version of this map.  The original had a much
narrower hallway near the key that made it impossible for two players to
pass.  It also had *FAR* too much ammo/health/armor in the respawn room.

This version also has things to hide behind on the sniper nest and a fixed
re-alligned wall near the key-deposit.
