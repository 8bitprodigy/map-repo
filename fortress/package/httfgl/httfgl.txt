                        included to help mapmakers aviod the confusion that i had with the 
                        tf entities.(there really ought to be some tutorials on tf 
			entites somewhere)

Notes:
This map has over 1200 brushes on it so it may not run well on normal quake.(which is why
I put gl in the title)but it runs perfectly smooth in glquake with my monster 3d.heh heh
If you want to play it in normal quake you might be able to get rid of some of the grey by
typing r_maxsurfs # at the console where # is the max number of surfaces visible.(sorry i dont 
remember what the usual number is)This is my first attempt at a tf level so id appreciate any 
comments or suggestions youd care to send.(I started the next one before i even started writing 
this text file so send those comments quick)Iv tested this level as much as i can on my own.If you 
find any bugs or problems let me know.And if anyone comes up with an idea on how to get rid 
of 2fort4 once and for all id love to hear it.
Maps that badly done should be considered cruelty to Quakers!
