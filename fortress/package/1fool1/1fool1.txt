Comments                : Two Fort Design, capture the enemy flag and return
                          it to your fort's drop off point.  Has a secret
                          sniper spot, couple extra goodies to enhance your
                          playing.  Let me know what you think or if you have
                          any ideas you'd like to see in future maps.

Thanks:  Id Software, the greatest of games.  TeamFortress, making a great
         game even better.  QuakeWorld and GameSpy, I never knew life on
         the internet could be so easy.  Last by not least, Armin Rigo
         for Quark, what a great and easy to use program.  Thanks a lot!
