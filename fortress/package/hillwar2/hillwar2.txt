Size:	This map is intended for 6-10 player games (total).  There's enough
		spawnpoints to have 12 people on each team, but that would get
		ridiculous once people start shooting :)

Gameplay:   Each team controls a valley-like area, and are separated from
		eachother by a hill/valley in between.	Enter the enemy bunker,
		take their flag, and bring it to the hill between the two team's 		areas.  At the start a large rock will block passage to the 			flags; once detpacked, the rocks disappear for the rest of the 
		game.

	    Scoring (team / individual frags in addition to teamfrags):
		- Detpacking the enemy rock - 2 / 1 - only once per game
		- Grabbing the flag while it's on its pedestal - 3 / 1
		- Capturing the flag - 9 / 3

            Respawns:	You spawn/respawn in a room with 5 teleporters to
		locations within your team's valley.  If someone is standing on
		a teleport location, a door blocking that teleport will close
		temporarily.  

	    Spam Detector:  The first two teleport locations (first two 			teleporters from the left) are vulnerable to nail spam, so there 
		is a large metal post up there that will warn everyone on your 
		team not to use these teleporters for the time being.

	    Supplies:	The respawn-room supplies are complete, but once you
		arrive on the map, you can resupply at the ammo shacks in each
		team's area, or you can use a resupply in a cave near the top
		of the hill between the teams.  This resupply is the only source
		of gren1s on the map.

            Detpacks:	As said before, at the start, you must detpack the enemy
		rock to gain access to the flag.  However, you can also detpack
		the enemy supply shack (detpack must be inside the shack), and
		deny the enemy any supplies for 30 seconds.
	  
	    "Bam4 ladders": The metal texture embedded into a hillside in each
		of the team-controlled areas is a "Bam4 ladder" -- jump onto
		the rock under it and walk into the ladder to climb.
