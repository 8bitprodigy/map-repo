-----------------------------------------------------
FIRST- Put vote1.bsp in your fortress\maps folder.

This is a voting map that runs between levels.  Players shoot the doors of the map
 they want to play.  Eventually, a door will open.  Run in and that map will start.

NOTE 1- Server Ops, this will not be able to access any map.cfg files, so keep that
 in mind when selecting maps.

NOTE 2- Hopefully this works well, and depending on feedback, I plan on creating a 
 second version with 20 or more choices.

NOTE 3- I am very open to suggestions on this, to make it better.
------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN----------------
All you need in your qwmcycle folder is map1.cfg with this line;
map vote1

And map2.cfg, with this line;
serverinfo n 0

Also, make sure you have this line at the end of your server.cfg;
map vote1

You can add other configs so every so often it will force a map to run, like a new map.
Any combination would work.

HOW TO EDIT---------------
I have included a pre-made vote1.ent file.  You make changes to this text file then
 run qbsp with this command line;

qbsp -onlyents vote1.ent vote1.bsp

Easy enough. 

WHAT TO EDIT---------------
All the ents you need to edit are at the bottom of the list, and labeled by netname as;
MENU -The entity that lists the maps on server.

DOOR1(thru DOOR10)- There are 2 each of these.  10 are the trigger_changelevels, where
 you need to put the TRUE map file name in, and 10 are the doors where you put the full
 map name in the 'message' section.

UNUSED DOORS---------------
I have left door 10 empty so you can see what to do if you don't want a door accessed.
 Basically, crank the health to 9999999 and set the message to 'Unavailable' on the door.
 On the trigger_changelevel, set the map to one you have, in case late at night someone
 trys to shoot this door forever and gets in.  It will just run a regular map, then
 return to the vote map.

In this release, the maps are presently;
1- 2Fort4
2- Well6
3- Rock1
4- 2fort_32
5- 2brave1
6- Canal Zone
7- Spaz4
8- Town2
9- Colony
10- Unavailable(just as an example)

Feel free to change at will.
