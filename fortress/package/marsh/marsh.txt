* Gameplay *

This map is really just a vanilla 2fort clone, grab the other teams flag bring it 
to the pad near your flag to score 10 points for you and your team.  If your killed
carrying the flag, it is dropped and will return to its home postion after 30 sec 
if no one on the enemy team touches it.  Blah blah blah, you know all this already.

How to use this map:
Copy the marsh.bsp file into your quake\tf\maps directory, now find a server playing 
this map and start to play.
