Description             : This is a fairly small map that may
			  get crowded and turn into chaos with 
                          16+ people. It's simple in design with 
                          a fair amount of water occupying the 
                          area between the 2 forts. There are 2
			  entrances, one through the water and 
                          1 through the 2 front doors. Both end 
                          up in the 'mosh pit' which has 2 ramps 
                          on either side leading to the upper 
                          level. Two hallways project out of the 
                          upper room leading to teleporters taking 
                          you to the key room. Grab the key and 
                          run back to your flag! If you make it 
                          back your team gets some health and armor 
                          bonuses as well as 10 points to your teams
                          score. There are 2 resupply rooms, one is 
                          in a room between the upper room and the 
                          water path  and the other is located in
                          the flag room.
