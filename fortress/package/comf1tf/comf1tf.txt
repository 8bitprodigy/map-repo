/////////////// Read below for playing properly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ or just run around like a Idiot /////////////////////////////  
*Install*
Copy the Comf1TF.bsp to the Fortress\MAPS (DIR).


*Game play*
Ok then this is an Enhanced CTF, When you start the map you will find your
normal FLAG on a little pedistal in the control room, the same Pedistal
has your Standard FLAG DROP point.


                     ((((Important)))))
You can drop the flag with dropitems,BUT Dont drop 2 things at once.
>use INV at the console to see what you have.<

You can Pickup Both flag's, see below. 
		     (((((((end))))))))

*Enhanced part*
This is my next try at forcing TEAMPLAY.

Skilled player's only, Get "YOUR" FLag and take it to the Enermy
Control Room, With your TEAM.
There you will see 3 console's on the Top level, They have Light's
RED & BLUE witch show who own's them.e.g. if Your red console has a
blue light you have a problem.

When you Capture a console it Closes off a ressuply point, you can
only follow a certain order, so just run past them all.

The order is, 1.first, 2, 3, then if you get the enermy flag you
can undo in the same order.(have a look at the map its simple)

Your Team's Resuply point are, 0 Slow (cant be closed), 1 low (closes),
 2 Nice=Give's Fire\Blarst armor (closes), 3 Best=Give's Nails\Bullets\Lightning
(closes). I think thats it.

*Map Story*
You City Foke what there land so kill them all.
You Southern's don't what them there kill them all.

*Story Behind the map*
It was going to be like the film, but the forest was to big.
I had busses(Illosinary), lots of thin tree's.
Maybe in QUAKE II. 
 

*Wouldcraft*
The best ever EDITOR, The key to editing quake is a line somewhere in the
WC Tutorial's it is something like this
" Treat it like LEGO just stick Block to block "
REMEBER DOOM\DN3D sidedef's,linedef's just to move a wall offten killed the level.  

*Ented*
Well what a tasty little program, I was doing a complex entity level,then
I read TFmap and decided ctf would do and then I found Ented v2.?.
Whitch was easy just point and click, but one day my map went back in time
by about 3 days work almost all the TFent gone(gutted).even with that delay
Ented saved week's.V2.5a took about 5min's to load my level .V2.5b about
5 sec's and there both as stable as it get's or need's to be.
Well what a tasty little program.

*TF Bot's*
Iv done the bot's for all my maps,but you will have to wait till the
Bot bloke send's them out.
