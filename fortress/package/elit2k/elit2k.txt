*Game play*

Grab the flag in the enemy basement and
bring it back to your capture point in the upper halway.

*New in Elit2000*

*A new entrance to the ramp room from the mine were added.
*I fixed some textures that were not properly aligned.
*The bridge were remade to decrees R_speeds
*Also some walls and more narrow entrance were added to decrees R_speeds

R_speeds=Lag in the map and can cause grey areas in the map.

*The door by the round hole in the floor were removed.
It served no purpose.

*A trigger push were added to the entrance of the ammo rooms so
respawn campers cant get in to the enemy ammo room.

*I fixed the stairs that diden´t work that you had to jump to get up.
A simple no clip texture were added so now it´s a small slope but you
only see the stairs.

*The total kb of the bsp is smaller the previous versions because I
fixed some overlapping walls, etc.
