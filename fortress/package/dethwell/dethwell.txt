* Acknowledgments *
The only one I can think of is my stupid school's network for dying yet again
and allowing me nothing to do but sit here and make this map so it could 
actually be released in the first map pack. Though personally I don't find the
nextwork dying as often as it does a good thing. Also give a tiny itty bitty
credit to the creater of well1 for the well in the middle of this map. Just
thought it would be amusing to put there. It serves no true purpose but to
break up the battle field a little bit.

* Misc Information *
This map has no flag or goal item. Just a plain out fragging. It's made for
4 teams of 2 though I'm sure a couple more players *may* work ok but I've 
never done it. 

* To the server operators *
If anyone happens to run this map on a server please e-mail me and let me 
know. Just call me the curious one.

If you have any comments or opinions you would like to voice drop me a line 
at my e-mail address given up top. Plus if you are going to criticize...do it
constructively. You'll get a better response out of me that way. If you notice
any major flaws let me know.

* Copyright / Permissions *
You are NOT authorized to put this BSP on any CD or alter it in any way

me.
