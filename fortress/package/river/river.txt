This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own base,
  at opposite ends of the map. 

The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
  key which is in their basement located in the basement.

Get 10 frags for yourself and 5 points for the team for a capture
  The Flag is returned after sitting for 60 seconds

hope ya like it. Cremy
