Revision Info:
This is the original release version.  Since this is my first
Quake map ever, and since TeamFortress (which ROCKS!) is pretty
complex technically, I might have made some errors in my TF
Entities that only a rank newbie would make.  If so, please forgive
any such mistakes in advance, and please don't throw out the baby
with the bathwater!  If I made any big errors, I would REALLY
appreciate some advice on how to correct said errors.  Send any
such info to fries@hog.net.  That's why I included all the source
material, such as the MAP file, the WAD file, the QED file, and a
fully-LIGHTed and VISed BSP file.

==================================================================

Play Information:
Capture the flag style map-- two teams, two flags. The flags are 
in the enemy's base.  Two towers, with deep moats, bridges, and 
battlements sit across two short straight WWI-style trenches.  If 
you can fight your way up through the enemy's tower, out the back 
is a catwalk leading into the palace.  Utility rooms are in each
palace, consisting of an armor room, an ammo room, and a medpak
room, as well as a Teamspawn Point room.  The flags are in throne
rooms, and the goals are atop the towers.

==================================================================
 
Features summary:
-This is not a complex map, nor a labyrinthine one, but it is 
 pretty big, and I believe that it can handle a full 32 players.
-Underwater access points for hunting sniper butt.
-One respawn room per team, with three respawn points each. 
-Huge outside area with trenches, towers, moats, and shadowy corners...
-Architecture allows all classes to be useful...
-Large spaces, with defensible chokepoints (but not TOO defensible)...

Base                    : Original first-revision map
Editor used             : Qed2
Known Bugs              : Perhaps it's just Qed2's fault, but a couple 
                          of boxes of spikes in the Red Team's ammo
                          room aren't showing up, no matter where I put
                          them, and even when I install brand-new 
                          entities to replace them.  
Build Time              : About 40-60 hours to edit, about two minutes
                          to BSP it, about 90 seconds to LIGHT it at
                          "Extra/Final" setting, and about an hour to 
                          VIS at the "Full/Normal" setting, Level 4.
