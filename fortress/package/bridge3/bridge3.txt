Details:

	Not much to it, Just deathmatch to your
hearts content and everything will be cooool and
everyting smooooooth.

	I got bored one day and decided to take
a crack at this map making stuff and here's my
first shot at it.

When I get better at this I'll turn this into a
TF Map, I have a couple ideas for it...just dont
know how to implement them just yet...but I'll get
better and so will this map. See Ya!
