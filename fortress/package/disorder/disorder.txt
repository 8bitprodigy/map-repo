This is a small QWTF CTF map designed for about 4 to 8 players. It took about 2 days to complete. It uses the ikbaseq3.wad and q1rad.exe light compiler. a .lit file is included for clients that support colored lighting. If anybody uses this map, or if anybody finds errors letme know. I might even do something abut it :) Also if somebody hosts a server with this map PLEASE let me know. Id definately log on. hard_core666@swirve.com My name is Kieran but you can call me..
