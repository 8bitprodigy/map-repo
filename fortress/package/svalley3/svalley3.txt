================================================================

* The Aim *
	
	Standard Capture the Flag TF. Actually, it's a computer chip, and you have to process it,
but you get the idea. Silicon Valley, as in the place where your computer chips are made. Figure 
it out. There is also the opportunity to score by detpacking the enemy computer center.

================================================================

* Latest Version *
	
	Svalley3 is a complete overhaul of svalley2. I've completely re-textured and re-lit it. 
Also, I've started cleaning up the map, removing excess brushes and textures. Also, I've added a 
great deal more detail to give it a more thematic edge.

As mentioned above, I added a little bit to new gameply. Now the computer center, where a team 
takes the enemy flag to capture it, can be temporarily destroyed. The computer will bebuild itself 
after 10 seconds. The demolitionist will be rewarded 3 frags and his team receive 3 teamscore. 
Hopefully this will add a little bit to relieve the monotony of capturing the chips over and over.
DO NOT attempt to destroy your own computer. I have no mercy on llamas.

================================================================

* Other Info *
	

	Well, this map is pretty simple. Two forts at opposite ends of the map separated by water
(hmmm...sounds familiar). However it is not simply a 2fort<whateverboringsuffixattached> clone (if 
you are a llama who only plays 2forts, you will get lost, but dont expect any sympathy from me). 
In addition to a narrow bridge, there are two ledges high on each wall providing ways across the 
water. Of course, there are water passages to get you out of the water if you fall in. In
 addition, the valley (yard, whatever) between the two bases is large and contains two bunkers 
and a sniper tower on each side. THERE IS NO BLOODY SNIPER ROOST!! Use the tower. It actually 
requires some talent though, so I understand why most snipers are afraid of it. There is very 
little cover for the snipers, to prevent them from dominating the large yard.
	This map is intended to be harder than most to cap on. The chip return is set at 30 
seconds to make it more difficult for one person to cap alone by moving the flag forward bit by 
bit. Hopefully this map will force people to work in organized team fashion, such as offensive 
squads.
	When you steal the enemy's chip, take it to the computer terminal in the room below the 
entrance to the flag area. Team scores are the standard 10 points per cap.
	There is a door immediately up and to the left inside each base that can only be opened
by the home team; it's not a bug. Also, resupplies and respawns are separated, and the respawn 
doors are one way to (hopefully)prevent respawn camping and limit telefrags.

	Everything else you should find out in play.  :)
