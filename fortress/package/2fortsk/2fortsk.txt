* Construction *

Base                    : Imaginos started off by rebuilding 2fort23.map
                          when my 2fortSK was taking too long to VIS (I
                          let it run for 2 days at level 4 before I
                          stopped it, then another 1.5 days with just
                          regular VIS...I needed my computer)
                          Most of the stuff from 2fort23.map was scrapped
                          and replaced. Then it was handed to me and I
                          finished it off and did some texturing and 
                          lighting. I also designed the resupplies, which
                          I'll be releasing for Worldcraft pretty soon. I
                          did all the TF ent stuff.

Description: 

Well, I've been working on this one for a while. I love 2fort4.bsp, but it
DOES have some problems. Mostly I just didn't like the way it LOOKED. The
textures didn't bring it to life enough for me, so I decided to build my
own version. 

There was no way I was gonna get my hands on 2fort4.map to play with, so I
dug around on my old floppies and found a copy of tfmaps.zip, which contained
fastflag.map, 2fort23.map, havoc.map, storm1.map and deathx3.map. I set to 
work retexturing 2fort23.map immediately, and in a couple of days, with a 
little reconstruction in some places, I had a GOOD looking 2fort23. That
wasn't enough...there were no elevators from the basement, no direct ramp in
the ramp room...lots of little things missing. I rebuilt EVERYTHING that was
missing, including adding in the upper respawn from 2fort_32.bsp.

I was finally done. All the entities were working right, the lights looked
good, and the textures were beautiful. Now all I had to do was run:
LIGHT -extra 2fortSK.bsp
VIS -level 4 2fortSK.bsp
...
Sure...right. No problem, right? Wrong. Light took 2 hours. No problem, I'd
expected at LEAST that. VIS on the other hand...I let it run for 7 hours 
before I had to shut down and take my system home. Then I started it again.
It ran another 8 hours before a power outage. Then another 40 minutes before
ANOTHER power outage. Then I got drunk. Early the next morning, I started it
AGAIN. This time, I let it run over 2 days before I finally needed my system
more than I needed this level VIS'd. After I'd updated my website, checked 
all my email, and played a quick couple levels of TF, I started regular VIS
with no -level ANYTHING. I let that run over 36 hours before I finally just
gave up. We had a LAN game and I wasn't cancelling for that. Depression set 
in...

A couple days later, while talking to my dad (SK-Imaginos), he mentioned 
that he'd spent the weekend rebuilding 2for23.map with big brushes. I
begged him EMAIL IT!! So he did, he had to go back to work the next day,
so he told me to have my way with it. I loaded it up and played it. It 
looked great, so I started looking for problems...I found some. 

<shortening of story...hehe>

I fixed the problems, added what was missing, designed a new resupply room
system to cut down on the entity count, and polished it off. Then I compiled
it. Then we played it. :) Now you can play it too!


How to use this map:

Unpack 2fortSK.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory. If you want to run
it on a LAN server or just take a peek at it, load quake with -game fortress
and type MAP 2fortSK in the console to load it. 

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the 2fortSK.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory.
