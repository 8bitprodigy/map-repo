========* Construction *=======================

Known Bugs              : A 'possible' bug: In some locations, sentry 			  guns fall through the floor.  This is because  			  the walkway/object above the gun is low 			  enough to interfere with it...

=============* Other Info *===========================
Description: 

	I hope you all enjoy playing on this map.  I tried to keep the
overall playing field small and simple, to keep the overall complexity
down, I hate lag. :)

	The first difference in the map (in comparison to the 2forts series) is that the flag is in the TOP of the Keep, and the return point is in the BASEMENT... During playtesting, I saw several people run the wrong way... :)

	I've only had ten people on the map so far...  I'm not sure 32 people will be playable, but it would definately be interesting... :)  I'd guess that about 20 players is the limit of playability...
