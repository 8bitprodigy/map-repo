* Other Info *

This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own ship,
floating in the upper atmosphere of a jovian class world.

The objective is to infiltrate the enemy ship, and capture the enemy
flag which is in their cargo bay by the warp core.The flag must then
be returned to the captain's chair on the player's bridge.

How to use this map:
===================
Copy the tfship.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or uake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake. In the console, type "map tfship" (without the
quotes)

Neat Stuff to Look For:
=======================
Don't forget to ride the shuttle between the ships.  Sure, you can teleport
between them...but then, how will you get a look at the ships from the
outside?

Design Notes:
=============
Our team has wanted to design a Team Fortress map ever since we discovered
TF 2.1 and 2Forts4 early in the summer of 1997.  With that goal in mind, we
purchased Virtus' Deathmatch Maker, as it was the "easiest" editor to work
with, and started designing a ridiculously ambitious -- and woefully
uncompleteable -- level.  It involved four warring villages, a central lake,
and a cage of velociraptors (!) that, when triggered, would attack the
players as they went through their motions.  Neat idea...but, with Virtus's
product, we couldn't even get the cental lake area to compile without massive leaks and seas of gray areas.  Logically concluding that we must have been doing something wrong -- because no company would release a hopelessly crippled editor on the market! <g> -- we set to work on a less-ambitious project:  Two warring starships.  We knocked out one starship in record time, but, when vissing that relatively small ship took over two hours on a Pentium 166, we realized that we might have a problem with the editor and not with our skills.  Thus, with fear in our hearts, we
downloaded Worldcraft 1.17r Shareware and set out to learn it.

48 hours later, this level was completed.

I could -- and probably will -- write an essay explaining everything that
is wrong with Deathmatch Maker as a Quake editor, but that diatribe does
not belong in this document.  What *does* belong here is a heartfelt nod
towards the vision, skill, and capabilties of Mark Kusec and Rowan Crawford
for their fantastic product "WorldCraft".  We will register it ASAP, and we
urge everyone who is working with this product to do so as well.  These
people have earned every cent they have asked for this editor!  This simple
level could not have come into existance without them.  For that, we owe
them our thanks.

TFShips uncompresses to a heft 1.1 MB.  We're considering creating a
4--team variant, with the different ships linked by the bow to a small
space station, but we'll see what kind of response this map garners.

The Worldcraft map is available for all those that ask, with the condition
that this design team is referenced in a readme document as base designers.

Have fun!  See you online!
