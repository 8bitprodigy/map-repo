*Gameplay*
There are 6 points in the enemy base to cap on. Your flag is at the lava
in your base. You first cap CP1 then CP2 and so on, untill CP6 which loops
back to CP1. The CP order is: Lava CP1, Bridge CP2, Water CP3, Circles CP4,
Rook CP5, Attic CP6. In each respawn is a rune, it will tell you which
points (both yours and enemys) are active. There is a 10 second delay in
getting the flag at the start of the match, and after each cap. You must go
touch the flag to start the timer. Dropitems is enabled with an 8 second
return on the flag when it is dropped.
