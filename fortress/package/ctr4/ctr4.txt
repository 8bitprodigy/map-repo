Description             : This map is made for the
                          Team Fortress Patch. It won't be fun
                          playing it without the patch.

  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from

  This is a capture-the-rune map designed for four teams.
  The goal is to capture the rune, that's located in the horizontal enemy base.
  Then, you have to return with the rune to your own base, and stand
  on the circle. (You'll find all that stuff out when you start playing).
