Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

  The idea is just to kill, and kill a lot.  Designed to improve 
1 on 1 fighting skills.  Each team has a respawn room with an exit 
to the top and bottom levels.


*You may distribute this map freely as long as this text file is 
included. I don't care what you do to the map, but it would be nice
get some credit and maybe an e-mail telling me about it, so I can 
check it out.  =)
