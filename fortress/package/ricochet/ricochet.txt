Gameplay: 
	Ricochet is a capture the flag variant. Each base contains a single flag. However, each base has three capture points: two are on the lower level, one is behind a closed door on the upper level.  The flag is taken to the points within the enemy base, not returned to your own.  The lower capture points may be taken in either order. Once both are taken, the door behind the flag area on the upper level will open. The path to the third capture point is then open. Once the third capture point is taken, the door will close and the capture points reset. The offense then begins capping sequence again.
	Once the doors to the third capture points have closed, teleporters will allow players to leave that area. The teleporters will take each player back to his own base. (Warning: these teleporters are always active and will teleport anyone at anytime, even if you are carrying the flag. Be careful where you step or you may end up back at your own base.) There are also teleporters in the two lower level capture points that may be used by the defense. They return the players upstairs to the flag area.
	After the lower level capture points are taken, a flag will appear there to mark that they are capped. These can not be picked up, they are only markers. After capping, the flag will return to its original location. 
	Flag return time is 60 seconds.
	The doors to the water entrances must be shot to open.
	Elevators are usable by both teams.
	There is a windtunnel in the respawn allowing quick access between the two levels of the base. To go up the tunnel, press against the wall opposite the door and jump.
	Teams are limited to 2 snipers for class balance purposes.
