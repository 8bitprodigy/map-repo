*Overview*
This is your basic grab the enemies flag and run back to your base kind of map. Bring the
enemy flag back to the glowing Quake symbol on top of your fort to capture it. Scoring
works just like 2fort4, 10 points for everyone on your team. If the flag is dropped it
returns after 90 seconds. There are some Biosuits in a room underwater so slow classes can
swim back to base without drowning. Also of note are pools of slime, teleporters, and some
really fun lifts. There are no secrets.

*Version 2 Changes*
Got ride of all decorative door jams. Made the doors on the outside flag return entrances
work for any team. Changed spiral stairs so that they only go from the basement to the
ground level floor. Added new hallway and ramp room at the back of the forts, as a second
way up to the top floor. Must have some ramps! Made the hallways in the lift rooms by the
teleports shorter to increase enemy players chances of coexisting with sentry guns and
pipebombs. Got ride of the pools in the respawn rooms. Maxed out the backpacks! Now you get
100% red type armor w/extra bullet protection, 100 health, 100 shells, 100 nails,
50 rockets, 100 cells, 1 detpack, 2 grenades type1, 1 grenade type2. Backpacks refill
every 5 seconds. I hope this makes everyone happy :) Changed the lava around the flag rooms
to slime, much less lethal. I also added doors on all four sides of the inner flag rooms,
this is to give the stepping stones and slime around it more of a purpose in life. Made the
stepping stones a little bigger. Changed the flags so they don't return when touched. The
scoring system now works just like 2fort4. Fixed a bug with the lifts. Relocated the 
teleports to the middle of the upper rooms. Added the covers to the bridges. Whew! I think
thats all...

*Version 1*
Bigforts1, the first playable version! sort of...
