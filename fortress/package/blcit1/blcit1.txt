You can extract all of them at once to your fortress directory
and it should place them in subdirs accordingly.

==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress Capture and Hold style map.

There are two teams to this map, Blue and, rather predictably,
Red :)

The map consists of 2 team bases connected to a main section by
a series of courtyards, hallways and platforms.
To score points, you must take your flag to the platform in the
centre section. Once captured, your team then defends the 
capture point from the other team, who are trying to capture
their own flag there.

Scoring:

- 10 points per capture
- 5 points there after for every 20 seconds you hold the capture
  point.

Notes:

- Flag carriers move at half normal speed
- The capture point area contains two resupply packs
- Snipers are limited to 2 per team

==========================Misc Info=============================

This release is more of a test of the whole Capture and Hold 
style gameplay, rather than a proper map as such. If it works
(and people enjoy playing it) I'll do a decent version with 
slightly less bland textures :)
I may also add some other features I've been fiddling about
with, such as having the team in control of the capture point
respawn in that general area, or having the team NOT in control
respawn in random places throughout the map to prevent camping
of their base (which may prove a problem since the flag carrier 
moves at half speed).
See info at top for where to send any feedback etc :)
