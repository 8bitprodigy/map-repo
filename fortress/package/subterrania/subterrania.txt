Storyline:

    The Royalty in control of the earth has used up most of the recourses left on earth,
they have trashed the lands and polluted the air to the point where human life can not exist.
Desperately, they and the other townsfolk dig their way underground where it is still warm.
Oxygen is produced by a process known as anxi-quanzination, a mix between mossy water and carbon
dioxide.  The process is faulty, and can not supply near enough air for everyone in the land, so
the Royalty have decided to lock the Castle gates and keep themselves alive.  The townsfolk are
left with no other option than to revolt against the kingdom and prevail once and for all.

To those of you still playing Quakeworld Team Fortress, thank you for your ongoing support.  The
future of Team Fortress is held in our brittle hands.

Have fun and Enjoy!
