Gameplay:  This is a somewhat standard 2forts setup.  Get the flag from the enemy
           basement and capture it in your sniper nest.  There are 2 bridges 
           connecting the forts, each with a small supply depot in the middle.  
           Each team can only make use of the depot with their team colors.  
           There are no water entrances to the forts, but they're connected by 
           underground tunnels.  The internal layout of the forts is similar to 
           standard 2forts in a gross way, but many details are different.

Credits:  Thanks to id for the engine and TFS for the mod (both kick ass).
          Thanks to my clan [DoW] Dogs of War for feedback and testing and support
          and all that good stuff.
          Thanks to @xl for the awesome textures.  Most of the textures in the map
          are from @xl's wads and the rest are my modifications to his textures
          (my changes were mostly adapting the textures for team colors).
