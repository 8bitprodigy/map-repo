 This is your basic capture the flag map.  The twist is that
instead of trying to get as far down into the enemy's fort
as possible, you start at the bottom and work your way up.

The resupply room is a donut around the largest room.

Each time you reach the flag, your team gets a point.  
When you capture, your team gets 10 points.
