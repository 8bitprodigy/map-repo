* Game Play *

This is a dual map for multiple players. Two players fight while the rest can watch.

To join the middle arena you need to have the two items: a key and a backpack, and then just go through the teleporter.
If a player enters the arena everyone will be given quad/pent/ring/bio for 5 seconds, then the fragging can begin.

* Other Info *

I strongly recommend to set friendly fire OFF. Some players just can't wait :)

* Legal stuff *
