 Description : A very team oriented map. Kind of a 2fort map but different. Each team                      captures their OWN FLAG! IN THE ENEMY FORT!

or from ftp.cdrom.com.

	It does not include the tfstan.mdl for the flag cuz You can get it with so many         other maps. I figure everyone has it by now!
        
======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress  "TEAM!!!" map.

There are 2 teams,
        RED and BLUE  (original concept, eh?)

POINT SYSTEM:

        Each team takes their OWN! FLAG! out of their OWN FORT! and advances and plants the 
        flag in the ENEMY FORT. Capture points are located behind flags on the rampway. They         are raised with a checkerboard on top.  A capture gives 15 frags to everyone on the         scoring team plus 5 secs of quad.

***This is a bi-level map. Entrance to the underground can be found under the stairs in        front of each fort.
