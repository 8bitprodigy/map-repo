Title                   : Bunker Hill Release 1

Description             : Two similiar forts on opposing ends.  Each fort
                          is raised on a steep hill and overlooks a 
                          bridge.  You will have to explore for the 
                          rest.  It is capture the flag based but it 
                          takes a key to open the door to the flag room 
                          and there are only 3 per team.  This is my
                          second map and should look noticably better
                          than Small Forts but my r_speeds still need
                          some work.
