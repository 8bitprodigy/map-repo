Jeremy and Robin went totally overboard, in helping me out.
The larger portion of the CTF work was done by them, and they
deserve more credit, if not all.

* Other Info *

  This is a new CTF level that has 2 bases (castles). Your
goal is to retrieve the enemy flag, return your base touch
your flag with the enemy's (Capturing the Flag).  Its one of
the first TF maps with this capability, so I am very proud
of it, and I couldn't have done it without Robins TFEntEd
or any of his help.  This is the FIRST CTF-TF map.  Although
the CTF maps are compatible, none of the CTF maps have the
TF Detection Entity.  This map may be too small for a 16
player game, future maps will be larger, I apologize for this.

* Upcoming News * (2/22/97)

I am working on a PowerBall level that is based on E1M1.
Most rooms are very similar, and the level just plain
kicks butt.  This map (tf_01net.bsp) is a little small
for 16 players, so when I am done with the powerball level,
I will change a few things around and make it the next
map (tf_02net.bsp).  No release date has been set.
