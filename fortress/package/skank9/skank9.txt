======================= Game Play ======================== 

The Goal is to take the key at your base and attempt to open the steel doors
        at the enemies base.  Once all 5 doors have been opend, the nuclear reactor
        must be DETed.

10 team points for each door.
50 Points for a sucessful DET of the reactor computer.  The reactor computer is the one in 
     the reactor room... get it???

========================Tech Info============================

If you notice far walls disappearing and leaving gray areas or doors not
showing from a distance, add the following lines to your autoexec.cfg
file in your id1/ directory:

r_maxsurfs 1500
r_maxedges 2500

This will increase the range at which polygons are drawn, thus making
far walls visible.  It helps on other maps like 2fort_32 also.


======================= Misc Information ========================

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake,
Thanks alsoo to the people at http://www.chateaucafe.com/ for providing a

Thanx to no one important in the TF map making community as they are all
  stuckup assholes.
