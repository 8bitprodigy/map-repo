* Other Info *

This is my second Quake map, the first being TF_ATDEF which was a
Team Fortress only map. But when designing this map I started playing the
3 Wave Capture-the-flag system as well, so I thought I would release this
new map for both Quake addons. The idea originally was to have 2 huge
underwater bases that you could swim in and around. However, Quake couldn't
manage all of the brushes in one huge room, so I opted for 2 identical bases
seperated by water.

Next map? Dunno, haven't thought up a good idea yet. Maybe a 3-4 team map?
Any ideas anyone?

* How To Play This Map (Team Fortress) *

First of all you need to unzip the .BSP file into your QUAKE\ID1\MAPS
directory (creating the MAPS directory if you haven't got it!) or place
it in a MAPS subdirectory in the Team Fortress directory
(eg \QUAKE\FORTRESS\MAPS)
