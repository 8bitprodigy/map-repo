Leagal stuff:
This file is to be included with the level if it is posted anywhere.
The contents of this file are not to be changed or modified in any way.
This map and file are Copyright (c) BigBallZMaN 2001.
This map may be used as part of a patch or for part of a campaign, all I ask
is that this file is included and the title is unchanged. Try and get in
touch with me if you want to do this, and I'll see about sending you the .map
file, I'd just like to know where my stuff has gone, that's all.
