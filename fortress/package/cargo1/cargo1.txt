Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.
It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

Get into your opponents base (in a group of a few people) and press all three
buttons situated around the base. Then you can enter their vault and steal
their goodies. Exit through the vault entrance or try the secret passage
(the little vent thing). Take it to your "processing" area (marked by a sign)
and your team gets stocked up with the goodies you stole from the base.

You can open up another entrance to the base by going into the lower
area and setting a detpack on a crate next to the wall closest to their
base

There is a board in the main room in each base displaying the status of each
teams vault doors (green is closed, red is open). I thought that might be
useful considering how pissed off i get whenever someone says "where's the
flag?" when it's in the bloody base (USE FLAGINFO YOU FOOLS! :) )

There are a few gripes I have about the layout, but cargo2 (when/if it gets
released) will be a fresh start again for the whole map. They layout should
be the same, but minor differences/better flow etc..

How to use this map:
Copy the cargo1.bsp file into your quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then connect to a TF server playing the map, or if you're up for 
a bit of solo action (so to speak) run quake (or glquake for that matter)
and in the console, type "map cargo1" (without the quotes)

FINAL NOTE: I know how much my box model is! I can't model for shit so if
anyone wants you can make a cool box model and send it to me so i can
distribute it with the current cargo1 zip, and include it for cargo2. 
Credit will be given (of course).
