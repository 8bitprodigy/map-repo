Description             : 
	Its the middle of the night in a desert far in the future where war is a everyday thing. During the day your air conditioning units better be running or you will be baking in the heat. But of course to cool down a huge base you will have to have plenty of power and your enemy over the mountian has plenty of power stored in there lava vats so steal there flag and the flag will give your machine the codes to access there lava vat power and your pitful base will get air conditioning for another day. So go forth and steal there flag with all there plans.
