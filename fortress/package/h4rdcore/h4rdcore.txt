*Gameplay*

This is a two team capture the flag map.  There are no frills,
unique scoring methods, or powerups.  It's called hardcore for
a reason.  Capturing the enemy flag on your cap spot scores 10
team points.  The goal obviously is to cap as much as possible
while still defending your flag.

*Design*

Due to lack of time to really work on the Hardcore Map series I
did some talking around and eventually NeVeck[M] reworked the textures,
lights, tons of brushes, and added new architecture of hardcor3.bsp.

* How to use this map *

Copy the h4rdcore.bsp file into your quake\fortress\maps directory. Then
join a server running the map.
