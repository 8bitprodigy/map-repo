Size:	This map is intended for 10vs10 games.

Gameplay:   Each team controls one wing of the temple, and spawn in the
		graveyards.  The objective is to capture the standards (flags)
		at the end of the other team's wing.

	    To get to the standards you can:
		- use one of the two wooden-framed teleporters in
		  the bone-walled rooms, or
		- you can swim through the blood pool at the end of the hall
		  with the shambler statue in it

	    Once you have the enemy standard, take it to the black spike in
		the center of the map to capture.  After the flag is captured,
		the capturer is impaled upon the spike (i.e. killed).

	    As a side note, you can be killed by the enemy before you're impaled,
		if the enemy times his shot right.  This will prevent you from
		getting	the two (individual) frags normally awarded upon
		impalement.

	    Scoring (team / individual frags in addition to teamscore):
		- Taking the flag while it is on its pedestal (0 / 2)
		- Capturing (10 / 0)
		- Being impaled on the spike after capture (0 / 2 incl. death)

          Resupplies:  There are three kinds of supply areas in this map:
		- The supply areas near the respawns (graveyards) give
		  full health/armor/ammo every second, but give no gren1s or
		  gren2s.  Additionally, any enemy who enters this area will
		  take 2 damage every second.
		- The supplies in the bone-walled room over the shambler-statue
		  hall give some health/armor/ammo, and a gren1 and can be
		  used by both teams.
		- There is a yellow armor and some health near the lava pools
		  in the middle area of the map.
		- There are no gren2 supplies anywhere.

	    Stained-glass Teleporters: The stained glass windows are teleporters.
		They act as an additional two exit/entrances into each team's wing.

	    Shambler-Statue: Don't worry, it's not real.  (not like a sniper
		couldn't kill one in a few seconds anyway =)  It should block
		weapons fire however (although I've noticed you can sometimes
		shoot through its arms/legs.
