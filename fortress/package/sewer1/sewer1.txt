Gameplay: Capture the enemy flag. Flags are deep down in the bases. You can
          follow the natural flow of water to the flag area. There are a few
          new items to spice up the map:

            Teleporter: You can teleport to the enemy Lobby. But you'll only
                        be enclosed in a cage and very vulnerable. You need
                        a teammate in their lobby to press the button to let
                        you out.
            Detpacks! : There are a lot of things to detpack. The green brick
                        wall is 3 layers, and takes 3 detpacks to be cleared.

******************************************************************************

Updates:  Made update to fix a detpack bug. A demoman could place a detpack in
          the water tunnel and prevent all passage. There's an invisible goal
          that strips a detpack off a player in the water tunnel now.

          Fixed the Pipe/Wall blown messages.

          The secret blast armor room door doesn't squish anymore.
