* Gameplay *

You go get the key from the enemy base, and take it to the basement of your 
large building. There are four squares each with different textures. These
squares are the places where you take the key to capture. The electroinc looking
one will allow your team the use of your vehicle. The blue one will allow your
team to use the scuba gear. The red button looking one will close off your teams 
underwater passage, allowing you to have only 1 major choke point. The plain red 
square will activate the security system. Along the back wall there is a small
inset place to score (once you have already scored on the 4 places) but it will
only give your team frags(use it last)

note:to get any of these to work you must capture first

The Vehicle- travels inside the other teams base when you press the red button
on the walkway on the right.

Scuba- basically a biosuit, located in your underwater passageway just to the
right of the stairs.

Door- closes off the underwater passageway.

Security System- Should tell your team when an enemy passes through your main
gate and through your underwater passageway. You can bypass security if you jump
in water and climb out on the ledge and come up in the middle of the courtyard
