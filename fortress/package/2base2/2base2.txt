Changes since version 1 : Upstairs windows are bigger, so you can get onto
                          the roof of the veranda.

                          There's exits to the recharges which go to the
                          centre area.

                          Home team key needs to be in place before you
                          can complete capture of enemy key.

                          Some new graphics.
