Title			: Charlatan's Compound

Version			: v2.5

Fixes since last	: v2.5 - Added two r_speed's to the mid-nest area
			       - Totally NEW textures
			       - Added two new nests to each base
			       - Removed the notorious speed cheat bug
			       - Removed the extra respawn doors
			       - Added a trap door to the top nest
			       - Pulled the top nest, yet closer to the enemy base

			  v2.0 - Removed un-necessary polygons (ie. The
			         Guardrails are much simpler than before.)
			       - Re-made the upper nest, you'll find it
			         is now much differant from the before. It is
			         now extended out farther and a differant shape.
			       - Added a water entrance
			       - Believe I have fixed the airstrike
			  	 problem for the Mega TF servers.
			       - Also added another r_speed to the mid-
			  	 nest area, you'll see what i'm talking about.
			       - Enlarged the Flagroom, Changed Lava to
			  	 slime, added ramp to leave ramproom, re-did the
			  	 hall leaving the flag room, added in a pit
			  	 which can be seen as a hazard for those leaving
			  	 the flag room or a new way to the flag, you
			  	 decide. =)
			       - Pulled the bases closer together,
			  	 hopefully this will fix the ever evident sniper
				 bug.

			  v1.1 - Removed some lips to doorways leading to
			  	 the ramproom as well as some lips to and from
			  	 the respawns.  I also removed a bar which was
			  	 actually a bug in the first one version, it 
			  	 was at the front door between the doors.

*==Description of Map===>

The map is the basic capture the other team's flag, no complex detpack 
goals have been added at this time.  

As for a water entrance there is one now, for this version, there will
be no detpack necessity added.  However if it turns out to be the main
route of traffic, then such things may be added. 

There is one main route to flag and one main route out, they are through
wind tunnels of which each team can use, Unlike in Silvforts.  There are
4 routes to take in order to get to the wind tunnel to go in to the flag
chamber.

Since I am a fellow sniper myself I've aimed much of the surface base at
being a sniper environment, there are roughly 10 good spots to snipe from
on the surface in each base.

Engineers, there are some lovely places for you as well in this map.
You'll notice in the ramp room, which is complex in my opinion, that
there are numerous places to place a sentry and just inside the main gate
I've added a ramp up against the wall similar to the one in Silvfort,
except it is larger just for you guys.

As for secrets, Sorry guys, none on this map you can look to your hearts
content, but don't think the thought didn't cross my mind and that they 
won't be in future versions either =)
