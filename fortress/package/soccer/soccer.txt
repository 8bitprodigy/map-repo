Description		: This is a MEGA-TF soccer map, unlike sandball
			  (made by dyermaker and ambush) soccer is a 
			  simple map, you get to choose your own class
			  and kick-ass while you play soccer.  This is
			  NOT a big-time map, I made it for fun and
			  people liked it! :P

Additional Credits to	: DyerMaker for sure, she helped out alot answering
			  questions, to bad her site "BluePrints" went down
			  it was a hella helpful site!  Also thanks should
			  goto WarMachine for helping me understand alot.
