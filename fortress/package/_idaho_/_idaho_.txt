* Other Info *

        Idaho is a TeamFortress Level designed for two teams. It is a 
capture the flag style map. The player who captures the flag gets 10 FRAGS. 
All the players on his team are rewarded with 5 FRAGS. That team also gets
a TEAMSCORE of 10 points.  Hopefully this will lead to more team play and
strategy being implemented, as was originally intended.

	Idaho has some neat crushing ceilings (which are triggered by cruel,
mean players), some useful flashing alert lights (which come on when the
stronghold is being invaded from the "wheel-basement"), some docile
volcanos, some rising cages, some mercy and peace, and some goodwill to all.
Now that's something.  :-)

	Basic Strategy:  In order to capture the flag you must get into the
	opponent's stronghold.  To do this you must either go down and 
	across through the basement (which sets off the alert light, 
	"Oh no!"), or you must drop into one of the volcanos on your 
	opponent's side.  This will trigger the opening of the stronghold 
	gate which is at the end of the raised wooden platform. Run across
	that platform and barge your opponent's flag. You can also drop into
	the bases from above if you'd like.  That's always fun.

	Once you have the flag you must take it to the middle of the sniper 
	loft which is on your side of the field.  Of course, to get up there
	you have to use one of the side teleporters which are on your 
	OPPONENT'S side of the field.

**UPDATE INFORMATION**
This version of Idaho fixes the little glitches found in the original.  The
volcano teleporters now work fine which should add a whole new dimension to
the level as you're used to it. Also, there are now 5 ways to get into the 
enemy stronghold where before there were only 3 functional ways.  I also 
added some new rooms with special items in there to liven up your wanderings.

**NOTE**
All of the Mercy, Peace, etc. stuff in this level is there for IRONIC HUMOR.
It is not there as an attempt on my part to subtly indoctrinate you all 
(that's what the HIDDEN SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES throughout the level are for....
In fact, even as you read this text file you are being secretly influenced
to email me your credit card numbers and bank statements.) I simply thought
it would be humorous to run around slaughtering each other in such a nice,
quiet, peaceful place. Plus, I'm a Christian and I like that stuff.
