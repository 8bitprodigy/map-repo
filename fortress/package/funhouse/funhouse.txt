Thank You: I need (and want) to thank thank realistik from Clan SinTheTiK
who has helped me out a whole bunch. He made the balloon model for me since
I couldn't manage to do a thing with qME. He also fixed some "bad" textures
for me too. And last but not least he listened to all my bitching and moaning
about every single problem I encountered. Thank you realistik! Please do not
send negative comments to realistik. He is an innocent bystander. Feel free
to share good comments with him, I doubt he'll mind =]

and there... Look below for a better description.

GAMEPLAY

Funhouses is a capture the flag, or in this case balloons, map. The basic
layout of the bases is similar to 2forts but there are plenty of things here
and there that will add a sense of being different.There are tricks and
traps here and there. Some are potentially deadly and some are just to be
goofy. The enemy balloons are in the enemy basement in a small house of
glass (also called a house of mirrors). AS a BONUS for those of you who
actually read this readme I will say that when you grab the enemy's balloons
there is a teleporter right beyond them.Just take an extra step and you will
enter it. It only takes you to the next room but if there was an enemy
demoman with a pipebomb trap, just waiting for you (with a smirk on his face)
it could come in handy =] The enemy balloons are captured behind the clown
hat on your funhouse roof. The resupply packs are in open rooms! I repeat!
The resupply packs are in open rooms! This will be very evident once you
play this map. HOWEVER, the resupplies do NOT refill enemies. It does
however make it difficult to just sit in there. This is NOT meant for an
open invitation to respawn camp which is a lowly form of gameplay. BUT if
a teammate is about to grab the balloons it would seem beneficial to keep
people busy with something else while they ran like hell now wouldn't it?
Let's try to show some self-control everyone... Resupply packs resupply
you FULLY every 1 second so it shouldn't be necessary to sit on one pack
for any length of time. I had to cut myself short at 230 or so entities 
(I think that is a lot...) but I would have liked to have done so much
more! There are trains, elevators, platforms, fake walls, wind tunnels,
airfans,and all kinds of other stuff. Rooms are pretty big since I was
met with some resistance in my 1st map making experiment (skys48)of small
confined areas... OK! Let's PLAY!

*******************************************************************
UPDATES IN VERSION 2

1)Rocket jumping tube now allows good rocket jumpers and very good grenade
jumpers to access the balcony.

2)I have outlined the air fans and put big arrows on them. Now for God's
sake stop complaining! If you can't get over that little square of lava
now you must be a freak! ;)

3)The main elevator is now twice as fast

4)Many walls of water have been removed, including the one between the bases.

5)Removed some platforms to keep entity count down.

6)Made the Quad backpacks refill after 2 minutes instead of 45 seconds

7)The room next to the glasshouse now has slime instead of lava in it

8)Only the backpack in the basement refills grenades

9)There are now 4 trains between the forts instead of 2 and they are faster!
In other words.... GIB!

10)This map is now VISed for GL (If you use GL you may have a slight
advantage due to the water transparency. However, using GL makes it
difficult to find the air tunnel that takes you to the balcony once
you are in the enemy fort.) NOTE: that GL on lower end machines could result
in slow gameplay.
