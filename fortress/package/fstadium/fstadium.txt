  This is a two team capture-the-flag(football) map. Each team has their own base,
at opposite ends of the map. (Where have I seen this sentence before ???)

  This map is based on a cross-breed between football (soccer) and american football.
The premise is a little dodgy but here it is.  The opposing team has captured your prize
football. Such a blatant slight can't go unpunished so it is your duty to penetrate the 
opposing teams changing room complex and retrieve it.  Prefereably killing lots of opposition
along the way.  But beware, as the other team has installed an advanced security system! 
  Once re-captured return your football to the display cabinet located in your base.

  Score 10 points for a ball capture and 1 point scoring a touchdown.

    The grappling hook has been removed in this level (i think) 'cos it didn't really
work.

  There is one re-supply point in each base.

  There is a (not very) secret underwater complex that allows sneaky back-stabbing
attacks.  :)

  Also there are footballs located in your base. Score a touchdown with these and
you will be rewarded with a frag and limited Quad damage.  

 
* Map Design *

  I was trying to come up with a sligthly more original premise than just
capture the flag.  I think i have pulled it off; however the map may still
need optimising. I await feedback on this point.

* How to use this map *

  Copy the stadium.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map fstadium" (without the quotes)

  If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the fstadium.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory.
  It may also be worth putting a copy in the quake\fortress\maps directory.

I have to admit that I am not entirely sure where the mdl files should go.
In theory it should be in fortress\progs (i think) however i found that
TF would not find them here, but when i put them in quake\fortress it did.
I suggest you place a copy in both locations. 

Have fun.
