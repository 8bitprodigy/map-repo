Description &
Comments	 

		:This level is designed to be used in Tiny Team TF. That is the same 
		as regular TF only with Tiny Teams. 
		 
		To score make your way into the second story of the enemy base. At the 
		back of the base is a ramp leading down into the flag room. The flag 
		is tucked away under the ramp. Grab the flag. Run up the ramp. Into 
		the main ramps room out the main door and across the dark parking lot
		between the two companies. Your key return is in the left hand corner of
		the second story room leading into the flag room. It's the raised square
		on the floor.

		A Brief History of Docks:<p>

		Docks originated in a pen and inkwash drawing which formed part of a "Dungeon 
		Interiors" series I made to give the idea of what <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> was all 
		about.

		Then at WesterCon '77, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Kate Wilhelm and Damon 
		Knight brought me to an actual D&D game which, up until that time, was just "some 
		game" that friends made up and other friends played.

		When writing levels in Wolfenstein, ROTT, G.O.D.D. and others, I often used this 
		theme, and in the G.O.D.D. engine, you will find this same scenario in splendiferous 
		detail and very increased size with no vis problems.

		Vising this map was a pleasure and a breeze, and I want to take a moment to thank my 
		Bardo pal Kru-ruk for the use of his "Tanker Truck #1" for the center break. Wait 'til 
		you see his fully tricked out 18-Wheelers in his own levels! There's serious talk 
		amongst those who have seen them about driving one of those puppies home...

		I approached this like a real engineer would; I didn't draw a single wall until I'd asked 
		myself the magic question: What, exactly, is the problem? You can't possibly set about 
		solving a problem that hasn't been defined, except by sheer serendipity. Okay, so the 
		problem is defined thusly: where do people mostly end up actually playing TF?

		There are three main answers, and many more besides. The three answers I addressed 
		came from thousands of hours of online Quaking, in DM, CTF, TF and Hexen II. 

			Da Ramp Room. 
			Everybody loves a ramp room, and any class can have a great romp in one, so 
			this map features a rectangular ramp room as one enters the loading area of the 
			Red and Blue warehouses.

			Da Key Room. 
			There's a tiny little squidgy place under the upstairs ramp where you'll find a 
			glowing thing that looks like a credit card. That'll be the flag. Take it out of this 
			close-combat zone to your base, upstairs and to the left just across from your 
			respawning room. Can't miss it. This little room is destined for some truly great 
			fragfests.

			Da Great Outdoors. 
			Again, all classes can have fun out here, especially amongst those great diesel 
			tankers Kruruk put out there for me from his 18-wheeler library collection he's 
			been writing for his more advanced levels. You should see the ones that are all 
			tricked out!

		The storyline goes like this: Reddish Trucking International has a warehouse and 
		loading dock directly across from Bluish International Trucking, and neither one can 
		stand the fact, so they're after each other's credit card so they can use it to break the 
		other's bank and ruin their reputation, company name and good credit, such as it is. 
		Two tankers have come into the yard, one Bluish and the other Reddish. Whichever 
		team can run up the most bills on the other's credit card gets to gas up and win the race 
		to market.
