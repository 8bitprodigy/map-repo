Details: This map was created when i got the idea that HF should hold inter-clan battles, or tournament. And none of the TF maps out there were suitable in size for this type of play. So I created this map.

This map has a custom built prematch in side the map, and the main doors open after 90 secs after the first person enters the map. It's a plain old Capture the Enemy FLag map. Cap points are at the Teams' Flag location, So once you get the enemy flag, bring it to your flag platform. Simple as that.

An-Anti respawn camper system has been include in the map, if an enemy tries to enter your respawn room, that person will die upon crossing the door (or by touching the door) and he/she will lose 1 frag.

This map is my property and should not be altered or re-ented in any way, without asking for my permission first. So please don't do it.

HAPPY FRAGGING
