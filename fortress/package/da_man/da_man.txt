You need the TeamFortress patch for this map to function corectly!

Decription:

You just got a new job, but it seems your boss forgot to tell you something
about your job.  Well, of course you don't want to get fired, so you'll just
have to do as Da Man tells you.

Go into the enemy base, steal their bit of machinery, and then use it with
your own bit.

Copywrite:

Do what you like, just tell me if you want to use something (so I can look at it:).
Mentioning me in your own map would be nice too!
