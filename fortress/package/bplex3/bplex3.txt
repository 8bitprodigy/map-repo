*CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION*

	Removed the fans, they did not work correctly in QW.  Changed some messages
on things.  Changed the under water area.  Remodeled the Ramp room,  I like the new design.
Made it impossible for enemy team to enter Respawn room.  More importantly, changed buttons
to look for spanner hit rather then the "engineer" class (this was not working correctly in
Custom TF).  A spanner button is now outside the Pipe Room.

* Game info *

To start place pqr2.mdl, medpack.mdl, and rings.mdl in quake\fortress\progs
Next place pqr.wav in quake\fortress\sounds\items
Last put the Bplex3.bsp and this txt file in quake\fortress\maps

	This is a 2 team capture-the-flag style map.  Team 1 and team 2 
have their own base, at opposite ends of the map. There are 4 ways into
each others bases. The underwater tunnel which has rubble that needs 
to blown with a detpack, The main entrance, the cart that goes between 
sniper nests, and finally the bridge which connects to the ramp room 
of each base. In the hall to the bridge is another hall that breaks off
and leads to a lava pit.  There is a switch which is activated by home 
team and enemy engineer (hit with spanner).  This hall leads to the Key
and the special room (see below).

	The special room is quite neat.  There are 4 pipes.  When you detpack 
those pipes some of the lights in that base turn off.  One pipe turns off the 
ramp room lights, another turns off the lights in the hall to key, another 
turns off the lava room lights, and another turns off the respawn room lights
(NOTE: not all lights turn off, you have to see somewhat)  They can be 
restored if you hit the pipe with spanner.  And dont forget, the door is a 
home team door but a enemy spy and engineer (hit switch with spanner) can also
open it.  For each pipe blown the demoman gets 2 frags.  The engineer just 
gets the lights back on :)

	The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, take the enemy key 
which is in their basement. The key must then be taken to your 
basement and placed on the caution pad.  The room with the pads is right by
the lava pit.  You can cap on 4 different pads.  The pad with the backpack
starts the ammo rejuvenator.  Every 5 seconds you get 4-shells, cells, nails,
and rockets; every 30 seconds 1-gren1, gren2, detpack.  The pad with the armor
starts the armor rejuvenator.  Every 5 seconds you get 5-armor points added.
If you cap on the pad with the medpack it starts the health rejuvenator.  
Every 5 seconds you get 2 health points added.  If you cap on the pad with the
key, The team receives 10 frags and the person who captured gets an extra 5 frags.
	
	There are teleporters in different places of the map which take you
back to the resupply room, these only activate for the owners of the fort.
In the respawn room there is a resupply place.  There is also 5 bars,  
inbetween each is a place to get the TF armor(kevlar->bullets, wooden->nails,
blast->explosives, asbestos->fire, and shock->electricity).

	NOTE: There are 2 secrets in this map (mabye more, I'm not telling)
Anyway, there is the "Mega Charge" It give you 15 seconds of Invunerability, 
Invisibility, and Quad dammage.  Next there is "Mega Armor" Which combines 
the effects of the armor between the bars in the Respawn Room.  The "Mega Armor"
is cancled if you go back to the bars or you die.



	If you notice any problems or major things that need to be changed, feel 
free to email me (blog@hotmail.com) also if you like the level or just want
to know how I did anything, I will be glad to tell.
