Description             : Sorta standardish gameplay, but with 3
                          keys per team. Once you gather and cap
                          all 3 enemy keys, you can then proceed
                          to score.
                          Oh and try not to cap the same key
                          more than once per score, otherwise
                          it might screw up the key icon lights.
