Known Bugs              : You tell me, it's my first map
Build Time              : About a month to design/test after learning how
                          all the entities in TF are supposed to work.
                          Took 15 minutes to compile,
                          including a level 4 vis and extra light sampling.

*Game play*
Get into the other teams base, get their flag, bring it to the floor tile below your
sniper ledge and score.

Unlike other CTF-style maps, this one gives the player a frag each time they grab
the flag. The player that actually captures the flag gets an extra four (4) frags.
The rest of the team, as well as the capturing player, gets ten (10) frags for the
capture. This is to encourage people to stop playing deathmatch with TF classes.

How to use this map:
Copy the dahood1.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps directory.

*Comments*
If you have comments or suggestions about this map, feel free to send me some e-mail.
As a service to the TF community, this will be the only two-fort style CTF map I make.
My next map will be based on a new theme without flags, but I'm saving that until it
is done and ready to send out to the world. If you are a good model or texture designer,
please send e-mail if you are interested in working on some textures/models for the next
map. Depending upon the release date of TF2, the map may be a TF2 map instead of just TF.

Enjoy!
