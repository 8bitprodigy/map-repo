First Team Fortress Map. Yay!

How it works:
  - The object to steal is in the vat of slime located in the rear of their
    base. There is a envirosuit next to the walkway so you can take a dip
    without the added extras of pain.

  - Return the object to the rear of your base in the door behind your vat
    of slime. Go into the funky glowing analyser and earn yourself 10 points.

  - That dirt walkway in between the two bases isnt very stable. A high
    explosive device <COUGH> detpack <COUGH> could case a bit of damage.....

Go get 'em! :)
