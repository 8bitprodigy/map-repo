* Game Play *

This is a border-style map.
Which means the civilians (team 1) must reach a certain area and then get points for it, they are assisted by 2 guards and the 2 defenders must try to kill them.

Four steps to victory for the civilians:
1 - Use the landing vehical cross a slimy sea or take a biosuit
2 - Storm the beach (you won't find much cover) and make a hole in the defender's fort (the area which can be opened is differently textured, it is closed in a minute)
3 - Follow the road (hunted style, don't get off the road) to the black end and you've made it!
4 - Goto step 1  

Team 1
Can only play civiclian, unlimited players
Must reach the end

Team 2
Can play any class, players limited to 2
Must defend team 1

Team 3 
Can play any class, players limited to 2
Must prevent team 1 from reaching the end

* Other Info *

Good teamplay is required for this map, I've tried to give team 1 enough anti-spam protection from team 2 with backpacks in case team 2 is spamming. But the map won't be the same as with good teamplay.

And I haven't been able to test the map with more then two people so I haven't got a clear view if the map is balanced enough. If you think team 2 should have more ammo or team 3 needs an extra players to make the map more balanced just mail about it.
