* Other Info *

I played Sniper War some day and thought: "Why should this fine map be only for snipers?"
I had the .map of this level (from www.quake.inet.fi) so I decided to make 
it more than just a sniper-practise-arena. Now bases have frontdoors, separate
respawn-rooms and water and bridge at the middle. No special goals, just fraggin' for
fun (as the original Sniper War was). Great for clans to practise rushes to enemy base
while snipers try to stop them, or TF-duels. 

Exact differences between AW and Sniper War
-Removed the clip-brushes
-Cutted doors, cleaned that a bit and added small stairs
-Added the separate respawn-rooms with the base-style look + doors
-Added the water with the Zerstörer-texture and the bridge
-Copied the sky-texture from Rock1, hope Sgt. Thundercok doesn't mind
-And less light outside, it's night there
-Allowed other classes to play, just in case you didn't notice

* Legal/Almost so info *

Do not edit! Re-vis if you want to, but it doesn't help much here. I think re-visin is
cheating, because if the map needs transparent water the map-creator will do it him/herself!
Get Sniperwar-source and make your own level if you want some holes, more light or anything.
