================================================================
Title                   : Shanghai Noon beta2
Filename                : shnb2.bsp
Author                  : ]KwK[.dp.
Description             : ctf with two castles and catapults.
================================================================
added in beta 2: 
took grappling hook out (thanks Soldier)
made packs give everything instead of just health or just ammo (thanks Genesis)
fixed a few textures/lights (thanks me)
added more indepth explanations in the txt, for those idiots who couldnt work it out themselves (thanks everyone) ;)

* Play Information *

TeamFortress            : Yes, about 16 players _should_ work well
New Graphics            : All new, textures taken from ikblue.wad and the following dm maps: 				Auhdm2, Exdm5, Lilith, Mjdm1pro, Xl1dm6 (i think most of these 					used textures from quake3/daikatana/hexen2 etc.) thanks
				
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 1.6 and 2.1
Known Bugs              : the catapult doesnt always shoot you up the top, just stand at the very 				back. some textures need work, but doesnt really affect gameplay                  
Details: Capture the flag, two teams. Flag is on second floor of each castle, accesible by going up lifts or spiral or being catapulted up, cap point is opposite your spirals. The flag return time is 1 minute 9 seconds (you figure it out).
from the respawn the teleporters under the windows lead you into the pipe, the others into the main entry/stair room
the flag room bars cannot be opened

CATAPULT EXPLANATION
you can only use the catapult in front of the enemy castle. the button on the catapult is not shootable, you need to have one person press the button while the other person is sitting on the catapult spoony bit (towards the back works best). presto! the button resets in 30 seconds


Installation: put into fortress/maps dir (use "quake -game fortress +map shnb2" to play)
