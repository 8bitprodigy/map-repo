Size:	This map is intended for 10vs10 games.

Gameplay:   Each team controls one wing of the temple, and spawn in the
		graveyards.  The objective is to take the standards (flags)
		from the end of the other team's wing and bring it to the black
		spike in the center of the map.  The red and blue teams are
		referred to as the Sect of Fire and the Sect of Ice, respectively.

	    To get to the standards you can:
		- use one of the two wooden-framed teleporters in
		  the bone-walled room, or
		- you can swim through the blood pool at the end of the hall
		  with the shambler statue in it

	    Once you have the enemy standard, take it to the black spike in
		the center of the map to capture.  After the flag is captured,
		a member of the enemy team might be impaled upon it, as well.

	    How this execution thing works:
		Essentially, one of each team is designated the scapegoat
		upon exiting the graveyards without using the teleporter.
		If this designated scapegoat is within his team's wing when
		the standard is captured, he is executed.

	    As a side note, you can be killed by the enemy before you're impaled,
		if the enemy times his shot right.  This should not affect
		gameplay in any way.

	    Scoring (teamscore and teamfrags):
		- Taking the flag while it is on its pedestal (first touch): 1
		- Capturing: 9

            Respawns:
		You can exit your respawn in two ways: By walking through the
		teleporter, or by simply walking up the hill there.
		The teleporter will take you to a resupply room outside your
		team's wing.  Walking up the hill takes you right into your
		base.

		Also, the respawns/in-wing resupplies will do 4 damage/sec
		to any enemy who enters there after a delay of two seconds.
		The outside resupplies that the graveyard teleporter takes
		you will simply teleport intruders away.

	    Resupplies:
		I'm not going to detail all the supply packs / armor / etc.
		in the map here, but I will say that the packs in the bone-
		walled room in each team's wing can be used by *either* team.

	    Shambler-Statue: Don't worry, it's not real.  (not like a sniper
		couldn't kill one in a few seconds anyway =)  It should block
		weapons fire however (although I've noticed you can sometimes
		shoot through its arms/legs.

CHANGES SINCE 1.1:

Changed: COMPLETELY redesigned center area of this map from scratch.  The new
	center area looks/plays nothing like the old one, and is *much* easier
	for offense to pass through without having to fight the enemy o.

Added: You can now use a teleporter to leave your respawn and go to a room outside
	your base.  These rooms will teleport intruders to locations in the
	center area of the map.

Changed: Respawns have been moved further away from your team's wing.

Changed: You now take 4 damage/sec if you enter the enemy respawn areas.

Added: You can now enter the enemy wing via two grates in the floor of their blood
	pool.  These grates open upon being touched, and stay open for five seconds.

Changed: The stained-glass teleporters have been replaced by the ordinary-looking
	starry texture usually used for teleporters.

Changed: The teleporters that send you into the enemy wing's front area (where their
	blood pool starts) now teleport you higher up in the air.

Changed: Instead of executing the capping player, a member of the enemy D is
	(sometimes) executed upon capping the enemy flag.

Changed: There are no more lava areas, but there are still supplies outside the
	wings.  Specifically, a megahealth in the blood that flows below the central
	spike, as well as some red armor and healths in some other places.

Changed: Instead of red and blue teams, you have the Sect of Fire and the Sect of
	Ice, respectively.  Colors are still the same (duh), but messages are
	a little different.

Changed: The two teams' wings are 10% shorter.  This is because I couldn't fit
	both wings and the new center area in the 8192-unit maximum length/width/
	height limitation imposed by the Quake engine.

Changed: Some small cosmetic changes.

CHANGES SINCE 1.0:

Fixed:  Your team should now get frags when you cap.  Previously only the capper
	would get frags (although teamscore worked fine).
