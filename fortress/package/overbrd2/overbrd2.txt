Notes, soapbox, and assorted propaganda:

  Overboard is a simple CTF map with no fancy rules or anything, just plain old
CTF, that looks (blow my own horn) pretty darn cool.  It started
almost a year ago when I first saw 2fort23, and my roomate at the time said
basically "my god this map is ugly".  Teamfortress might have been the coolest
quake patch ever but a lot of those early maps were a little lacking as far as
beauty and realism is concerned.  I decided at that point to make my own TF map
and created the ship you see in this version. Mind you that old ship kinda
sucked so I sunk it :).  Anyway, I played around with a bunch of different map
concepts and designed a bunch of buildings and stuff, and then dropped the idea
and went back to playing Threewave CTF.

  Then, Sgt Thundercok released Well6.  Man what a map.  I had to finish mine! 
So I played around with a few more building designs, and then gave up again.
Finally Sgt Thundercok released The Rock.  This is as far as I am concerned the
best all around map available for TF.  Seeing just how cool the prison cells 
were made me want to do something approaching the same level of coolness.

 Over the next few months I finished the inside of the base, and
got the map together. I redid the ship, and made some pretty flags. 

I think this map is probably a little slower than most - but not much.  It is,
at least on my system at home (p150 32mb) proof that being a minimalist when
creating a map is not that much of a boon to FPS, just a time saver for the
level designer.  Mind you, I've never had 32 people playing this map, and I
may be forced to eat these words :).

This map will not run with 8 meg of heapspace.  If you want to check it out
in regular quake, use -winmem 16 on the command line.

I've made concessions to GLQUAKE players by reducing the sky area (which 
seriously chokes GL) but if you decide to revis this map for transparent water
then I am sure it will be slow as all hell. This was not entirely unintentional.

Please email me if you have any comments, suggestions, hello's, or bitches.
