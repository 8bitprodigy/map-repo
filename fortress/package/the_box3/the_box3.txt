Description             : This map is made for the 
                          Team Fortress Patch. It won't be
                          fun playing without it.

* Play Information *

  This map does not work properly without the 
  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from 
  http://www.planetquake.com/teamfortress/
  or
  http://mordor.netlink.ch/games/tf/

  This is a capture-the-flag map designed for _four_ teams (Well, 2 or 3 teams can play
  it as well). The goal is to capture the flag, that's located underground. To get there,
  just fall down the hole that's in the middle of the map. Then get the flag, and use one
  of the teleporters to get back to the surface. And then run back to your base, and drop
  the flag at the dropoff point (which is located at the end of the "pill box", beside the
  wall tourch).

* Other Info *

I released this third version after I was going to
make a 32 player level out of it.
But when I started I removed most of the roof, and found out that
the size of the "box" was not correct.
And then I found out that the bases was not in equal size.
So I fixed that, and did some other things like puting the
flag model instead of the key, and did some minor changes to the
item_tfgoal settings.
I also put a sky over the half removed roof, and removed the
water that was in the hole (the flag looked silly underwater).
I also put some new textures around the level, to make it look better.
Hope you lake it. :)

Now I'm off to make the 32 player version of the_box.
Stay tuned!
