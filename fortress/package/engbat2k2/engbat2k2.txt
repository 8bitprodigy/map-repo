Installation
============
Unzip engbat2k2.zip into your \Quake\ directory! The following files will be places in their correct directories:

engbat2k2.bsp	-	\Quake\fortress\maps\
engbat2k2.lit	-	\Quake\fortress\maps\
engbat2k2.txt	-	\Quake\fortress\maps\
charge.mdl	-	\Quake\fortress\progs\
minibase.mdl	-	\Quake\fortress\progs\
turrbase.mdl	-	\Quake\fortress\progs\
turrgun.mdl	-	\Quake\fortress\progs\
turrspot.wav	-	\Quake\fortress\sound\weapons\

NOTE: If you use a custom Sentry Gun Model or Sounds turrbase.mdl, turrgun.mdl, and turrspot.wav will overwrite these files. To keep your custom Sentry Gun, please back up those files, unzip this file, then place your custom Sentry Gun files in the correct directories, while overwriting existing files.


Gameplay
========
Two teams consisting of only Engineers. Try to steal the enemy team's turret segment located near the back of their base and bring it back to your turret segment's stand. Turret segments are returned immediately upon dropping them.

The lack of resupply areas is intentional. This map was designed to persuade Engbat players to rely on their Batteling skills, instead of good sentry gun placement.
