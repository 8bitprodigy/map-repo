======================= Game Play ======================== 

Blue and Red fight each other to capture the enemy key and invulnerability rune. Blue and Red's bases are identical except for the textures.

Objectives:

- Normal Key Capture : Take enemy key from the key room and take it back to the stained glass dragon texture in your fort.
- Rune Capture : Only a player carrying the enemy key can take the enemy rune. It has the same return point in your fort as the key - the stained glass dragon texture. Unlike the key, the rune returns to it's start point as soon as it is dropped so one player has to carry it the full distance. If you succeed your entire team gets 20 secs of invulnerability.

Things You Might Want To Know:

- Each team can use a detpack to blow the underwater grate that leads to the lava room. The grate stays open for 30 secs, then it closes and a door in the lava room opens, allowing access to the rad suit and teleport. (Hint: go in a few at a time.)
- The rad suit can be used to swim through a hole in the lava pool and drop directly into the key room (be prepared to take dam).
- The teleport beams you to a special room near the enemy return point - ready to kill.
- Only a hwg (either team) can pick up the armor near the key room.
- Only an engineer (either team) can open the hidden door in the lower ramp room.
- Only scouts can open the lower lift door.
- Those damage switches take a lot of dam (one well-placed mirv will do it).
- Getting in alone won't be too difficult, but getting out with no help from your team will be another matter.

POINT SYSTEM:

Key Capture - 10 Frags for each team member, 10 count.
Rune Capture - 20 Frags for each team member, 20 count.
Key Grab - 1 count.
Rune Grab - 3 count.
(I think that's it. Suggestions welcome.)
