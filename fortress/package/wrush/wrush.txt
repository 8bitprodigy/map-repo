Map Help:
The object of the game is for the weenies (team two) to get past the
tough guys (engineers on team one). The two engineers (which is all
that team allows) build sentries within the blue lines and the weenies
(unlimited amount of people) hafta get themselves a strategic way to 
get past the sentries. Please send suggestions if you have any. I need
them since this is the first version.
