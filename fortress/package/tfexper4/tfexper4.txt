Thanks			: It is imoportant to recognize those who's input	
				  resulted in a significant influence over design
				  changes in this map.  Without these people parts
				  of this map would not have been possible.
				  Changes, as noted in the 'what's new' section
				  were inspired by Dyermaker and my partner in map making,
				  Greymon!  A big thanks to them and all who beta
				  tested the changes.
Description             : A 2fort style map with a smaller floor plan
                          and some interesting architectural variations.
			  	  This map is designed for a lot of fraging and 
			  	  is intended to be difficult to cap on if the
			  	  defensive plan takes advantage of the intended 
			  	  architectural designs.

Details:

Whats New?			: A review of this map by Dyermaker, while favorable, gave rise
				  to considering some changes.  They are as follows:
				  1. A new entrance into the basement area via a detpack'able
				     grate.  This is also reversible by another detpack explosion.
				  2. Sentry area doors are now only accessible by an engineer.
				  3. Moved respawns up to avoid telefragging.
				  4. There is now a 10 second delay on the activation of grenade
				     refills and you only get 2 type 2 grenades. An effort, however
				     feeble, to avoid spamming.
				  5. Widened lower respawn hallway from version 3, and added a little
				     alcove to hide in.
				  6. Quad damage was removed on lieu of the second egress path.	
				  Note: You can check out the latest map reviews on her talk show each 
				     week at http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/7065/bpmshow.html
				 A no clip texture was added to the side windows in the entrance alcove
				 to make it a little more difficult to egress the base with the flag.
			
Standard 2fort info-

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.
It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:
The blue team must capture the red flag from the basement of the enemy 
base, and take it to the battlement of the blue base.
The red team must capture the blue flag from the basement of the enemy 
base, and take it to the battlement of the red base.
Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.
If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it remains
for 30 seconds after which it returns to the basement.  Unlike standard CTF,
team members cannot return the flag by running over it.

Architectural info-

There are several key design features that make this map nicely designed for a defensive 
battle.  
First, the platform above the entrance to the flag chamber is ideal for the engineer to set
up shop.  It is also easily accessible to the resupply room making speedy level 3 sentry's 
possible.  
There is two ways out of the basement now.  The first is via the spiral staircase 
which is housed in a rectangular structure. This makes it very difficult for the speed 
demon scout to shoot up the staircase without losing his footing and falling to the floor
below and into the arms of the defending units.  The second is via a detpack opened grate in 
the floor which leads through some steep passages and out into the main water alcove.
The entrance to the base is designed in a way so as to force all incoming units to pass through
an alcove in the front.  This alcove has openings above for snipers to pick off unsespecting units 
as the enter.  This sniper positions protected from enemy sniper fire from the oppostion's base 
making it easier for the defending sniper to concentrate on the task at hand.

Enjoy!
