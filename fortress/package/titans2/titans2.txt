* Game Play *

Its got the same old titans special weapons of power but now the team 
goals are far easier. 
Each team must go capture the other teams half of the Shard of Onyx Bree.
When your side joins both halves the scoring system turns on and rewards you
with points every 30 seconds.
The other team must go break up the joined shards and try to capture the enemy 
shard for themselvs and so on.

Also whatch for cracks in walls to find detpackable areas, there are 2 places
on the red side that can be detpacked open.
