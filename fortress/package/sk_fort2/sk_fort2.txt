* Other Info *
Description: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Version 2.1+:
I'm SOOOO sorry to have to be releasing this AGAIN, but a couple of things
sorta came up. First of all, I found out the other day that Imaginos had
put a secret in the map without consulting me. Just so you know, in version
2.0, there was a shootable door when you came out of the water that hid a
megahealth and a red armor. The door only opened for friendly scouts.

Second, there were a few textures that we found we didn't like much, and we
decided that since there needed to be a rerelease anyway, we'd fix 'em. Also,
I remembered that some people didn't like the time/frag limits being set by
the map, so I took 'em out. Serverops are now required to set time and frag
limits for this map. (Or just let it run 24/7 with no end...don't matter to
me...hehe)

Third, the "sandwich" rooms (the ones above the basement ceilings) now have,
in addition to the red armor and rockets, a 25 health box. This was requested
by Mushi-[LOL], and I'm sure he meant more than 25, but that's all I'm givin'
today. :) Mushi is one of the most inventive players I've seen, so I thought
if nothing else, I could stick a box there to say "thanks!". Thanks, Mushi :)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Version 2.0+:
Okay, here's the new version. It will take a bit of getting used to, but the
gameplay on this map is great! Have a good time and enjoy the map. This is
the final update to this map that will be made. (Unless, of course, some
really NASTY bug showed up somewhere.)

How to use this map:

Unpack sk_forts.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory. Unpack gren1.bsp
in your quake\fortress\progs directory. If you want to run it on a LAN server
or just take a peek at it, load quake with -game fortress and type
MAP sk_forts in the console to load it.

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the sk_forts.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory and copy gren1.bsp into your
quake\fortress\progs directory.
