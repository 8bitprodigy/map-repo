This map was made by beginners in mapmaking, so it might not be 
the best Team Fortress map, but atleast we tryed it. Map was made 
intentionally different from other fe. 2fort-copies. The yard 
might be a little bit laggy when playing with a slow hardware and lot
players, but not much. 

To capture the enemy key, take it from the enemy flagroom to
your left tower and place it in the platform there. Upon doing this,
all team members get full gears. Becouse of that, defending is 
very important.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Misc. Info~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
