Description             : A two team TF map.  This map plays like 2fort4 in that
			  it is a capture the flag level.
			  This is a large map, but not a complicated map.
			  HERE ARE THE REASONS U WILL WANT TO USE THIS MAP:
				Have u ever wanted to know what the hell is
				going on in the other guys fort while playing defense?
				If u are playing offense and see your flag get taken, 
				do u wonder if the defense is holding it's own?
			  WONDER NO MORE!  This map has WINDOWS into the other fort!
			  In the ramp room, you can see their ramp room
			  In the flag room, you can see their flag
			  There are many other windows.
			  Beware of engineer's railguns...they can shoot through the glass
			  Engineers, beware u don't put your gun where it can see though
			  the glass:-)
			  The map will KILL respawn campers, so don't play this with
			  anything but the TeamFortress -game fortress switch...it won't
			  be nice:-)
			  ENJOY!
