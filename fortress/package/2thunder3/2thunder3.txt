I Did add something to spiff the map up. You will see when you enter your ramproom.
Just place this map in your maps directory. Nothin else needed. I don't really give a fuck if you modify this map, all i actually give a fuck is that you leave the e4 and the author and mapname on the worldspawn (startup). Uhm, The author of this map was Mike Toth a.k.a NightMare*F>e4 -- mtoth@wcoil.com is my email. I encourage you to email me naughty stuff. yes im a pervert. No seriously? Actually I'm not but i felt like saying something to piss people off. It's a great map and i hope its enjoyable. Have fun figuring out how to get the quad in the ramproom. (Why am i telling you where it is? It's glowing so if you don't figure it out, uhhhh then your beyond our help) And a word of thanks to e4, Gamesnet #e4 and To everyone in GP, gamesnet #GP; especially dominatrix[GP] Thanks babe.

Have fun, and if it puzzles ya I guess you could always lay a detpack somewhere and see what that does. Oh yes, there are 2 secrets... 4 total, 2 in each base same location. Uhhh.... 1 requires a grenade to boost you if your not a soldier. it is rocketjumpable. I think i gave it away already, but what the hell. Sweets go out to Steph @ LCC. Love Ya!
