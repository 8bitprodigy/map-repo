Description             : Team Fortress map. Basic capture the
			  flag level. 2 bases and a little cave
			  between. You can blow a generator when
			  a security door opens for 2 minutes.
			  By doing this you open another way
			  straight to the flag. There is also a
			  sewer in both bases. You must use
			  detpack to blow the sewer open at the
			  cave side. The another side opens when
			  you give a little damage to the grate.
			  Engineer can repair that side by
			  hitting the button near the grate with

Build Time              : I took the central upper cave from my
			  unfinished Quake2 level. I did that about
			  six months ago. Many of the other places
			  are taken from my TF map which grew up too
			  big for Qauke engine. This is a smaller
			  version of that map. Last parts added in
			  a week or so.
