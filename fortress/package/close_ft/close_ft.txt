* Other Info *

  This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own base,
at opposite ends of the map.

  The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
flag which is in their 3rd floor level. The flag must then be returned
touching their special goals on 3rd floor to capture.

  There are resupply points on the second and third level of each fort.

N.B. The grappling hook has been removed in this level.
