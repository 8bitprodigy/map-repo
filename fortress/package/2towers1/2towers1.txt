Release Notes:
	TeamFortress Capture the Flag map. The flag is in the tower and to
	open the door to the drop-off point  you also need the key.
	This map was designed for about 6-10 players. If there is more it
	will be far to difficult to capture the flag.
	Try take the enemy key and run away whit it.;)
