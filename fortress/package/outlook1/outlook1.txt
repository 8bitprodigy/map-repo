Release Notes:

This map has a number of features to enhance the strategy value.  As one person
said, Team Fortress is "The Thinking Man's" Quake.  I wanted to capitalize on this
by adding extra strategy points to the map.  There is only one flag that both teams
have to fight over.  Once you have the flag, take it into the enemy base to one
of the scoring points.  There are 3 scoring locations worth 1, 5 and 15 points, each
one is harder to get at than the previous.  To make things really interesting there
are a number of strategic switches.  

One switch creates a *very* quick shortcut to the 1 point scoring location.  This 
switch must be activated by an engineer's spanner.  Once activated an engineer on 
the opposing team can shut off the shortcut by hitting a different switch with their 
spanner.

A second key point is a small wooden wall in the opponent's base.  This can be blown
up with a detpack and it reveals a "sanctuary" for the enemy.  Don't let your enemy's
have access to this sanctuary!  A few hits from an engineer spanner will repair the
wall.

The third switch is actually a pair of switches.  One switch will activate your team's
teleporters.  The other switch will de-activate the other team's teleporters if they
are currently active.  The teleporters are extremely powerful allowing you to move
from your respawn into the sanctuary or from your respawn room directly to the flag

Don't hold on to the flag for too long.  If you hold it for more than 90 seconds the
map assumes you're hording the flag which is very boring for everybody and will kill
you.
