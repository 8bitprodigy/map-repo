* Game info *

	To start place pqr.mdl in your quake\fortress\progs.  Next place
pqr.wav in your quake\fortress\sounds\items.  Last put the 2HNiC1.bsp and
this txt file in your quake\fortress\maps directory.

	This is a 2 team capture-the-flag style map.  Team 1 and team 2 
have their own base, at opposite ends of the map. There are 4 ways into
each others bases. The underwater tunnel which has rubble that needs 
to blown with a detpack, The main entrance, the cart that goes between 
sniper nests, and finally the bridge which connects to the ramp room 
of each base. There is a section of the hall to the bridge that can be 
blow with a detpack.

	The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, take the enemy key 
which is in their basement. The key must then be taken to your 
basement and placed on the caution pad. The team who captures receives 
10 frags and the person who captured gets an extra 5 frags. I did this 
to encourage people to capture the key.

	Any team who captures the enemy key 10 times will receive a bonus,
this you will have to wait and see what it is!

	There are resupply points on different levels of each fort, these 
only activate for the owners of the fort.  In the respawn room there is a
resupply place.  There is also 5 bars,  inbetween each is a place to get 
the TF armor.

N.B. The grappling hook has been removed in this level.

	If you notice any problems or major things that need to be changed, feel 
free to email me (blog@hotmail.com) also if you like the level or just want
to know how I did anything, I will be glad to tell.
