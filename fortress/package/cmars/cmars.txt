Details:

Two teams, red and blue, have to capture their foe's flag and get it back to their own base. Your 
capture point is located in the corridor to your own windtunnel (a small nuke mark on the wall). Once you capture the flag, it returns and you and your team get 10 points. 
There are three ways to the enemy flag. The back corridor has a "secret" outside area, where you can find the powersuit. It gives you about 5 secs of invinsibility and 10 secs of Quad. That should be enough for the scouts to get the flag, IF they get the powersuit. The powersuit restores after 3 mins from the last pickup. Happy huntin'!
