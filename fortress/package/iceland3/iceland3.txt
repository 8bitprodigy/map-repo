Modifications:
Changes from version 2: : 1)  Bigger.
                          2)  Pad to take enemy Crystal to.
                          3)  Biosuits everywhere (prevents MegaTF toaster mod
                              from getting you in the water).
                          4)  Revised Sniper ledge.
                          5)  Snipers have a couple class-only ammo packs.
                          6)  Water way into the Crystal room - Risky!
                          7)  Illusionary hillsides for snipers in snow field.
                          8)  Deeper water so sentries work right (2.5 bug?),
                              and a pad to MegaTF "lay" on in Water room.
                          9)  Added a warp in lower ammo.
                          10) Removed 2 teamspawns in lower ammo, leaving
                              2-each teamspawns in lower and upper ammo rooms.
                          11) Added a darkened ledge in Crystal room for
                              defenders (where you warp to from l.ammo room).
                          12) Added "lights" and left lots of shadows.
                          13) Added a ledge & ladder in Main room above suits.
                          14) Added another ice_moving, more brooks & bubbles.
                          15) Added abominable snowman to Intermission room.
                          16) Moved Start to Intermission room.
                          17) Added Maphelp line.

Changes from version 1: : 1) Removed Gren2 in upper ammo.
                          2) Moved Crystals- they were getting on the sniper
                             iceburgs in the Crystal Room. (Sniper burgs are
                             team only!)
                          3) Added Intermission room.

Credits & Thanks:          * Midori, inspiration. The field in 2Brave1
                             was the tightest open area in a map to date,
                             probably until ICE LAND.

                           * My clan, the Kavorkians. Thanks guys for beta
                             testing, downloading all those failures, and
                             telling me this was worth it.

                           * Ambush of Ambushed! Mega TF Mods. He's my hubby
                             and overall hard-assed level-critic. :P

                           * All the people who play on our MegaTF server and
                             helped with ideas, constructive criticism, who
                             whined and bitched, who praised and glorified,
                             who never said anything but said it all anyway.
                             Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

                           * Ben Morris for WorldCraft. You oughta ask for
                             more than thirty dollars, dear. (I'm a female so
                             I *can* call you dear!) :P

                           * The TF Team for making TF happen! When will you
                             release the code for 2.6+ to Ambush???

                           * ID Software for making Quake happen!

                           * Greg Lewis for TreeQBSP. THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
