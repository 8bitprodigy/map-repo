*Game play*

Grab the key and return i to your computer and touch the consol on the left side.

*New in 2bunkers2*
Updated textures and some visual bugs,made a new bridge,put up a snipers nest a bow
both small bunkers and put a trigger so a sniper can fire the cannon.
Now the cannons fire 4 shots time´s 6.
Fixed the base sniper nest so you get a better view of incoming enemy.

Tips..If you shoot the doors on the sniper nest they open and you can make a double Rl jump up.
