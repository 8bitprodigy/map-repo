** Info about map **
Four teams. Red and Blue are the actual teams, Yellow and Green are
the civilians. Yellow is Blue's fan team, and Green is Red's fan team.
For either Red or Blue, take the ball in the middle of the field and
take it to your goal (hint, it's the same color that your spawn room
is).

Civilians have Quad Damage. And they get 1 point each whenever the
team there are cheering for scores. Teams 3 and 4 are limited to 6
players each.

How to use this map:
Copy the foozbal2.bsp file into your 
quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map foozbal2" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the 
foozbal2.bsp file into your quake\qw\maps directory or into one of the 
directories above. It will work either way. I would appreciate any 
suggestions you may have.
