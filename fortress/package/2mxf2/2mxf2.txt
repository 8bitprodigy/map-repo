* Release Notes *

This is a Capture the Flag style Team Fortress map. The flags are
located underground and the goals are located on the roofs. Beware of
the defensive traps when taking the flag! Each flag capture is worth
15 frags.

You can use the dropitems command to throw the flag if you are
carrying it. This can be useful if a slower class passes it to a
faster one. The flag does not glow when it is dropped.

I had to bring in the wall behind the fortress to reduce signs of the
GL bug. The fortress is now partly built into the rock, but it is
still built with a real fortress look.
