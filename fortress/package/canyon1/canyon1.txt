Description             : General Layout: I basically used the layout
                          of 2fort4 except it can barely be said it
                          uses it for a model. Instead of a bridge and
                          water there are huge rocks on a flat ground
                          between bases. A suspention bridge hangs over
                          the yard going not from one base to another
                          but perpendicular and exactally in the middle
                          of the base. The base walls are too high to
                          RocketJump in a single bound but gren jumping
                          and pipe jumping will do nicely.
                          Like in rock1 the water passage can be deted
                          open and closed. and like in street1 you can
                          cap to give your team an advantage.
                          there are 2 respawn areas with plenty of
                          spawn places i dowbt there will ever be
                          telefragging. one s below one is aove like in
                          2fort4 almost and you have a 50% chance of
                          respawning at the bottom. all resupply bags
                          give 200 of all ammo, 4 type 1 grens, 4 type
                          2 grens, health 200, armor 200 and a det pack.
                          
                          Capping area:
                          -----------------------------------------------------------------
                          Quad model: Gives your team access to a quad
                          bunker. Located on the sniper battlement
                          while you stand in it you cannot move much
                          but can aim freely with quad damage.
                          
                          Sentry gun base model: caping here will
                          activate the security system for the front
                          door it informes you of incomming enemies and
                          also tells what class they are. note spy will
                          not be detected. I left it out of the water
                          passage on purpose. Only the scout can be detected 
			  in the water passage
                          
                          Rad suit model: Your team has access to the
                          rad suits located by the enemy water passage.
                          it lasts a very long time, enough for you to
                          fiddle around all you want d=).

			  Medpack Model: gives your team health regeneration 
		          at the rate of 1 health per 5 seconds.

			  Armor Model: Gives your team Armor regeneration 
		          at the rate of 2 armor points per 5 seconds.

			  Shotgun Model: gives your team ammo regeneration 
		          at the rate of 5 shells, 5 nails, 5 cells, and 1 rocket
			  every 5 seconds.

                          TF flag model: Gives you points for capping
                          and will never remove itself, making it the
                          normal cap.
                          
                          -----------------------------------------------------------------
                          
                          Water passage: I made the water passage in a
                          dangerous location and you may use a det pack
                          to blow it open or closed as you wish ( all
                          resupply bags that belong to your team will
                          give you a det pack ) the water passage does
                          not have the security system on it. I suggest
                          you det it closed and when you see " Fire In
                          The Hole " You can guess someone is coming.
                          Requires a bit of skill. 
                          
                          Flag Return: The delay b4 the flag is
                          returned to base is set at 20 seconds. I did
                          this because i feel it is shit when a scout
                          makes constant runs on the flag and can pick
                          it up easy after dying. This makes it so you
                          must have a teammate with you to cap or you
                          better be really skilled. no lone scout can
                          handle this usually. Note, I have played this
                          in a game and it works awesome despite my
                          apprehention thinking it would make it less
                          fun. Well it is fun d=)
                          
                          Mortar: Located on the battlement; it is that
                          cannon looking thing. You can use it to
                          launch you grenades across the map, bombing
                          the ememy battlement. It pourposly aims at a
                          point that is key to giving the grenade
                          maximum coverage. You can time you grenade to
                          hit almost any portion on its aiming path. it
                          also aimes at the quad bunker for thoes pesky
                          LPB who like to mow us normal folks down d=)
                          Note: pipe bombs cannot be launched but this
                          is the only exception.
