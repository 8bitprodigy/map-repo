======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Control the Beer Can" map.

This is a small map for those like myself who can only find a few people to play with on the Companies LAN. 
You could play with a bunch of guys on this but it was intended for lunchtime work frag fests.
The central fortress contains a large can of Duff beer which scores 5 team points and 1 Frag to whoever
touches it first once every 15 seconds. There are two lifts, one in each tower on either side of the fort
 for entry. He who controls  the beer, controls the game! MmmmMMmmm BEER!

POINT SYSTEM:
Beer - 5 team points, 1 personal Frag every 15 seconds
 

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and all the guys that shoot me on the company 
network during lunch, without whom I would have no reason to make maps like this. Thanks Tim, Kevin O, Manny, Kevin C.,
Barry and Dave.
