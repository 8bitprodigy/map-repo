Release Notes:
	After playing Sniper Wars for a while I wanted something more.  I like the sniper class alot, but not all snipers stay right in the base sniper nest all the time.  So I decided to make an entrance into the mid battle field.  I also hated the people that threw flares all over the map and lag the server, so I took out the resupplying of flares.  Though layers start with a few flares I hope this will stop them from laggin the server.  I also got annoyed by running into my fellow teammates trying to get out of the line of fire and getting shot in the head, so the map is much bigger.


Well so far I have gotten alot of compliments about this map, so I hope you like it too and tell servers to run in at least in rotation with the other sniper map.  Also remember that this map was made for alot more people.

Happy sniping :)
