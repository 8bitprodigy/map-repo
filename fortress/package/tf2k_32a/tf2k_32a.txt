Spec:           Two Castles in a U shape.

Level info:     This map is a mix of many things in maps I have enjoyed.
		Maps like Well6, Ditch2, Realmd1, Darkages, and others have
		all been molded into this map.

		Its simple. Get the flag from one base, and bring it back to 
		yours, and cap it underneith the flag in your base, Just like
		Well6.
