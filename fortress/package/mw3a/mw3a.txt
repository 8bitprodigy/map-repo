Special Thanks goes out to Publius, for making me a modified version of qbsp. SpadE, 
Crono, Silencer, TiTaN for playtesting.  Revolver for filling my head with ideas.  Also, 
Puff and Scooter for giving me some real dumb ideas, but thanks for trying to help... and
of course, Id Software, John Cook, TeamFortress people (whoever the hell they are) and 
Snake69 for getting me involved in quake editing. 


Also, send me suggestions for a newer version of this map, or map ideas in general
