Hi. My name is Zang. I make maps for Team Fortress.
I made this one too. It is really keen. It is a DM
map for TF that is based on a really groovy idea that
Spudboy of the Spuditorials came up with.
He really sucks and so does his site. And so does this
map. But no one ever reads these text files anyway.

It is based I guess on the TF 2.666 code so you need
at least that to play it.
Oh, and Quake too I guess. And a computer helps as well.
And a monitor to see it on. Quake by teletype sucks.
Keyboards are good too.

Dr.Quinn says I am almost recovered and will be able to
leave within a year. That is good.

The bsp goes in your maps folder. The mdl goes in your
progs. And the wav goes in your sound folder.
Isn't that just whacked?

And I get $10 if I mention Spudboy and his spuditorials
at www.planetfortress.com/spuditorials

Whee!
