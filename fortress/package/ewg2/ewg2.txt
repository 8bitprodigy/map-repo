Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must capture the red flag from the basement of the enemy 
fort, and take it to the blue fort.

The red team must capture the blue flag from the basement of the enemy 
fort, and take it to the red fort.

Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.

If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it remains
for 30 seconds after which it returns to the basement.  Unlike standard CTF,
team members cannot return the flag by running over it.

There are three ways into each fort. (Front door, waterway and a secret teleporter)

The rest you'll have to figure out yourself. :)
