This is my first TF map and also my first Quake map so this wont probaply
be "perfect". Idea in this map is to capture other teams flag and take it
to the drop off point in your own base, or... just frag people :).
To get the flag (key) you must shoot button below the outside arena, which
will push out a slope to the flag room. Meanwhile someone else must shoot
button at the opposite teams fortress'es wall to open bars... then you just
grap that flag get it to your base and you will got ten frags + 15 secs of
quad damage.

Both teams also have two resupply backpacks. Just beware when you go and grap
it, the other sides resupply room will be just on the other side of that flag
room. Getting fragged by sniper (or by anything else) just before getting
that backpack, is not fun...

I hope (Read: hope you can read that text above).
