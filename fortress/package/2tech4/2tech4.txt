======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map.

There are 2 teams to this map. Blue and Red.  Blue and Red fight eachother
to capture the enemy flag. Blue and Red's bases are identical except for the
textures.  There are a lot of interesting devices to make this map interesting
and more fun to play:
	-Normal Flag Capture : Take enemy flag from their basement and take
	 it back to your flag texture in the Ramp Room.
	-Battery Capture : A Battery resides in the Top Basement, behind
	 a rock wall. The rock wall can be destroyed by a detpack. When taken
	 to your team's Spotlight on the Sniper Loft, it will award 5 frags 
	 to the capturer, and turn on the loft's Spotlight for 5 minutes 
	 giving the enemy snipers the disadvantage
	-Hacking : Engineers can help their teammates by Hacking open enemy
	 doors.  This helps for getting people in and out of the enemy base.
	 The Hacking Terminals are located in the main Ramp Room and are
	 switches on the computers.  The Engineer can Hack the following:
		-Front lift
		-Ramp refil
		-Basement refil
		-Main lift
		-Cave lift doors
		-Back exit lift
	-MegaCharge : This is somewhat a secret, there is a MegaCharge,
	 Which gives the carrier Quad, Pentagram, and Invis for 10 seconds,
	 plus it refils everything to the max. (grenades, health, armor) This
	 is extremely useful for penetrating ramp defense.
	-Spy Detectors : There are two Spy Detectors in this map, one of them
	 in the entrance to the Ramp Room.  The other in the Basement. The
	 Spy Detectors indicate if an enemy comes through, regardless of their
	 being undercover.

POINT SYSTEM:

	10 Frags are awarded for the flag capturing team
	5 Frags are awarded to the player who gets the enemy battery and
	installs it in the flashlight.

======================= Changes since 2Tech3 ====================

	-Spotlight feature added : taking your battery (in enemy base) to
	 your spotlight (on sniper loft) will light up the enemy sniper area
	-Little perfectionist changes, 'cleaner' refil, ASCII flag status...
	-Second route to main room
	-Second route from Ramp Room to Basement
	-Fixed small brush and texture allignment errors
	-Easy place for Engineer to hide between hacking
	-Muchly better gameplay
