There are 3 main levels and 1 roof per fort. Each Fort is shaped 
like a cat =). The eyes and ears are ideal for snipers. Check for
the creative texts when you get or cap flag =)!!

This map is fairly simplistic. There are no special buttons or 
even packs. Its somewhat geared to 2 forts in the essence that
there are 2 forts.  It is not a huge map but it is a somewhat
complex map.  It is Ideal for 10-32 players but more 20-30

The objective is to capture the enemy flag but it is not quite so 
simple. The flag is atop a platform that can only be reached by
blast jumping or riding a floating platform.  Also ther are doors 
and objects that move on ther own that block your way. Somewhat like
an obsticle course. This makes this map somewhat difficult for scouts
as they do not have the freedom to simply charge without resistance.

To score you must walk the tightrope outside between the two mountains.
The scoring pad is the same for both sides.
