		:This is your standard capture the enemy's flag and return it to
		your base to get points kind of map. The map was built to support
		all classes as best as possible. There may be a slight advantage 
		to one class or another. That will be accidental. 

		The look and feel of the map is medieval castles. The castles have
		been built with defense in mind. The castles have been build with 
		defense in mind. Yes, that deserves repeating. Actual castles were
		built to keep the enemy out. So we built these along those lines.
		This means that a good team with enough sentry guns can put up an
		almost impenetrable defense. Almost. It is possible to RJ to the 
		upper balcony. And it is possible for a sniper to launch a player
		across the yard from one balcony to the other. This along with a 
		few demomen, soldiers and sneaky spys will break up almost any defense.
		Provided you play as a team on offense. This map is not friendly to
		the lone offensive player. 

		We hope you enjoy playing as much as our clan does.
