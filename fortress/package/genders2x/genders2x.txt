Genders2 original by -I-J.Killer
Genders2x ent revision by Arc (22 Jan 2024)

Genders2x attempts to fix problems in both genders2 and genders2r.
Genders2 has yard spawns that lead to yard DM and conflict about etiquette.
Genders2r has spawns inside but reduces the expected caps from 3.6 to 1.5.
Therefore genders2x aims to prevent yard DM while also making the map more attack-friendly.

Changes from genders2:
-Setting a detpack at the enemy grate no longer gives 2 points nor opens it.
-Instead of a 36% chance to spawn in the yard, there is a 67% chance to spawn inside the grate.
-The attacking team can touch (or detpack) their own grate to open it for faster yard access.
-Using the jail teleporter still strips armor but no longer strips ammo (more viable for scout & medic).
-The secret resupply pack now gives a bit of armor/health.
-2 packs are in the grate water area (1 for O, 1 for D).
-The secret passage near the ladder opens for either team.
-Upper resupply spawn moved forward a little.
-Ammo in upper resupply replaced with a pack.
-Orientation when using the jail teleporter is the same for both teams.
