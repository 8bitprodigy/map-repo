==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a standard TeamFortress CTF style map.

There are two teams to this map. Blue and Red.

POINTS SYSTEM:

10 team points for each capture
10 frags for each team member for each capture their team 
makes.
Individual frags count in this game.

CHANGES FROM 2NIGHT1:

- One of the ducks has gone walkabout :)
- Outside has been split into two seperate areas, with extra
  passageways to and from each
- Lava in lower tunnel replaced by slime
- Extra clip brushes to prevent 'sticking' in key areas
- Doors added to some main crate room entrances/exits
- Watefall section replaced with rocky tunnel
- Some textures replaced with imported Q2 textures
- Several secret 'features' added
- Entrance to slime/lava tunnel improved

=========================Misc. Info=============================

Thanks to:

- TFS for the TeamFortress quakeC mod, and to id Soft.
  for Quake, easily the best online multiplayer game ever created
- [EQ]Wombat and [WK]Golliwog who helped me test the various flag
  entities, as well as suggesting a lot of new ideas and tweaks.
- [QTL]Cepheid for the use of his webspace for downloads during
  the beta test.
- [DA]Titanic for the use of his server during same period.
- Everyone who turned up to the 4 hour test on a dodgy fullbright
  level 3 vised map and went 'oooh' and 'aah' a bit nonetheless :)
