Detailed Map Info:

There are two fortresses, two Lava Arenas and the Center Arena.
The fortresses and Lava Arenas are assigned a color fore  
referencing purposes.  Each Arena has two touch pads and a flag
stand.  A team member must be standing on each pad for your
teams flag to go up in that arena.  The Arenas must be taken in
order, progressing away from your fortress.

The Point system works like this:  

Hold your Lava Arena: 2 team points per minute
Hold the Center Arena: 3 team points per minute
Hold the enemy Lava Arena: 4 team points per minute
Succesfully penetrate the enemy fort on a Suicide Run:  10 team points

There is health available just in each fortress, In the Center Arena
and in each tower.

There is ammunition available in the fortresses and in the Center Arena 
if your team controls the Center Arena.

There is grenades/detpacks/medpacks available in the front hall of your
fortress.

There is specialized armor available in the ramp room of your fortress.

There are no team powerups.

The sarcophogus is in front of a teleportal to the Center Arena.  
It will move aside if your team controls the Center Arena.

The "Score Boards" in the pond area represent each station on the map.
A Blue panel will show up if the section is controlled by the Blue team.
And, conversely, a red panel shows up if the red team controls the area.
The banners represent the fortresses.  This is a quick "Status Monitor" 
so teammates leaving the fortress can tell which stations their team 
controls.

When a player is standing on a touch pad, the rest of his teammates will
receive a message telling them that someone is needed at which arena and 
which pad they are needed on.

Final Notes:

This map REQUIRES team play.  It will probably not do well on "open" 
servers because of the team play required.  It works wonders at a LAN 
party, though.
