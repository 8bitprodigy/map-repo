Description             : This map is made for the
                          Team Fortress Patch (v1.3x or 2.0x). It won't be
                          fun playing it without the patch.

* Play Information *

  This map does not work properly without the 
  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from 
  http://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/
  or
  http://www.nano.no/~liam/tf/

  This is a capture-the-flag map designed for _four_ teams (Well, 2 or 3 teams can play
  it as well). The goal is to capture the flag, that's located in the middle of the map
  (You have to use the train to get there). Then, you have to return with the flag to your
  own base, and stand on the circle that's on the stairs (You'll find it all out when you
  start playing).

Cooperative             : No
Deathmatch              : No, not really....
TeamFortress            : YEA! (5 spawn points per team (See "known bugs"))
Difficulty Settings     : No
New Sounds              : The new TF sounds
New Graphics            : The new TF graphics
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Editor(s) used          : 100% WorldCraft (Ented wrecks all my maps).
Known Bugs              : Well, I haven't tested this map in a multiplayer game.
                          I think there's a bug at the respawn points. I always spawned on
                          the first spawn point, after I killed my selfe. So that's means 
                          that team mates will probably telefrag each other. I'll take a 
                          closer look at it some other time.
Build Time              : 4-5 hours
