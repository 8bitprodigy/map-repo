* Other Info *

This is a new version [finally!] based on Hedge 5 that some love, and others, well,
love even more. :)

Now about the level itself.  It's a night level with a lot
of open flame. :)  The main feature is a hedge maze between
the two fortresses.  The flags are in the basements, which
are reached via a descending platform on one side of the
room on the second floor.  You then return on a rising
platform that takes you up to the other side of the second
floor room.  Return it to the pool that's at the very back
of your roof.  If you can't find the pool, it glows. :)

The grey that plagued Hedge 5 and 6 is gone! :D

The following is from 2fort23.txt (a big inspiration for
this level; thanx to John Cook), and it applies here, too.

  "This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team
   has their own base, at opposite ends of the map.

   The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and
   capture the enemy flag which is in their basement.
   The flag must then be returned to the [pool on the
   roof] of their home fort.

   There are [two] resupply points on the second level
   of each fort.

   How to use this map:
     Copy the hedge7.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
     or quake\fortress\maps directory. Then run quake.
     In the console, type "map hedge7" (without the
     quotes)"

Please let me know any suggestions that you have for the
map; especially if it's TeamFortress related.  I've been
trying to make it balanced for TeamFortress play.

                   *** NEW ***

Here it is, the new Hedge; it took ~11 months but now you
have it. ;)

I blocked off the roof's view over the maze as it was drawing
nearly the whole level(!) from up there.  This made it slow
down and really grey up.

I have finally removed the grappling hook.  No servers allow
it anymore anyway, so this isn't that big of a deal.

I finally stopped the health from falling out of the level
and I placed to red armors in the middle of the maze to help
you on your way to attack...

I changed the frags/scoring system.  If you kill someone
on the other team, you get 1 frag.  If you capture a flag
you get 10 frags, your teammates get 6 frags, and the team
gets 1 point.  Hopefully this will encourage people to
go for the flag and defend there own while not being
frustrating because you get no credit for the 50 people
you just sawed in half...

Tweaked a few brushs, etc...

Be sure to read the strategies and info from previous
versions below as many things still apply.

Hope you enjoy it!

                   ***********

Team Fortress v2.1 adds the grappling hook.  I was going
to disable it on this level because I believe that it
completely disabled the entire concept of this level
(the maze and having to fight your way up through the
bases), but after many protests to the idea (and no
supporters) I decide to just make it so you couldn't get
into or out of the bases from the second floor or the roof.
(You can still get in through the side tunnels to the
roof....  Finding these are left as an exercise for the
reader. :)  )

Other new stuff:

I have added a few TF v2.1 enhancements; mostly with
respect to many different, specialized messages.  I also
have the key icon at the bottom of the screen light up
you have a flag (in case you forget). :)  Another thing:
the big flame in the middle of the maze hurts.  A lot.
Don't touch it.  It really hurts.  Am I clear? :)

I made some cool new light cages.  They really don't do
much to strategy, they're just new and cool. :)

                   ***********

Yes, it's dark.  It's much lighter than the last
incarnation, so be thankful. :)  I was going for a
hedge maze/flame motif.

The idea for the forts was for the defending members of
the team to stick to the "high ground": the second floor,
the roof, the ledge in the back room, the two guard rooms
on the first floor, and the catwalk above the entry.  The
attackers obviously go through the maze, and try to
infiltrate the opponent's fort.  Since you don't get frags
for killing people, and only for capturing the flag, it
makes sense to have that your sole target while attacking.
While defending, some snipers should try to cover their
teammates while they're crossing the maze.

Check out the roof.  There's some great views from up
there.  On the sides are tunnels that wrap and put you
above the maze; definitely heaven for some snipers. :)

Again, the flags are in the basements, which are reached
via a descending platform with the key texture on one side
of the room on the second floor.  You then return on a
rising platform that takes you up to the other side of that
room.  Return it to the pool that's at the very back of
your roof.  If you can't find the pool, it glows. :)

I really hope that this is an enjoyable level, and that
I've addressed the number one complaint that I've had:
it's too dark.  The other complaint was that it was too
big and tended too make encounters more random one on one
than team efforts.  I've simplified things a little more,
and provided this strategies section to clarify my vision
for this level somewhat.  Also, I believe that the
darkness and unfamiliarity may have made the level more
complex than necessary.

If you have comments, my handle is Raistlan and my
email's above.  Suggestions are especially welcome, as
it's a lot easier when I know what's wrong, and what could
be "more right." :)
