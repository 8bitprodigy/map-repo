Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec patch v2+.

It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must capture the red flag from the turret of the enemy 
base, and take it to the turret of the blue base.

The red team must capture the blue flag from the turret of the enemy 
base, and take it to the turret of the red base.

Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.

If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it remains
for 30 seconds after which it returns to the basement.  Unlike standard CTF,
team members cannot return the flag by running over it.

This is the first compleated(and distrubuted) map i have done.There have been serveral DM style maps
before this, but they have never seen the light of day(mostly due to HD failure!)

Enjoy!
