* Game Information *

Simple Game Play	: The map works exactly like Threewave Capture the
			  Flag, with slightly lower scoring.  You must take
			  the enemy flag to your touch pad, but your flag
			  must be present to score.  The only healing on the 
			  level (beside medics) is by dipping in the cool 
			  looking pool in the middle of the map.

Detailed Map Info:


1 frag, 1 point (duh).
Capture the enemy flag: 2 team points. 5 points for the capturing player.
Return your flag after killing the flag carrier: 2 points
