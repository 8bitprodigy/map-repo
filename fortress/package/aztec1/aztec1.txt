==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress "Sacrifice the Crystal (and yourself!)"
map.

There are two teams to this map. 
The tribe of Ifrit, god of Fire (red), and the tribe of
Leviathan, god of Water (blue), who are locked in a bitter holy
war for their respective deities.

To sacrifice the enemy teams crystal, you must go into their
base and take it from its alter deep in the enemy temple.
From there you must make your way out of the enemy base to your
own and place the crystal on the top of your sacrificial tower,
which is in the main courtyard.

POINTS SYSTEM:

10 team points for each sacrifice
10 frags for each team member for each sacrifice their team 
makes.
Individual frags count in this game.

=========================Misc. Info=============================

Thanks to TFS for the TeamFortress quakeC mod, and to id Soft.
for Quake, easily the best online multiplayer game ever created.
Thanks also to Martin Blunden (Deathwalker, aka GraveDigga) for
the crystal model, for sending me stuff like Vici and help
files, and for listening to me mumble about being too thick to 
use EntEd or set up my own TF server.
And last but not least ta ver' much to all you peeps who helped
me with testing and kept me playing TF when I should have been
working on my map. ;)
