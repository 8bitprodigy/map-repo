* Other Info *

  This is a four team deathmatch type map with an additional feature. The 
alternating day and night settings. Half the time it's all lit up, the other 
half the map is in almost total darkness. 

  Basically the objective is to survive as long as you can while surprising 
and fragging anyone you happen to see. :)

  There are resupply points at each respawn and also supply points on the 
level dispensing specific ammo or life and armor. There is also one supply which 
totally refills your life, armor and ammo and gives you quad and one supply
which gives you a pentagram. 

  Certain packs on the level give you gren1s, and one pack on the level gives 
you one gren2.

  The level starts of in darkness, causing some confusion at first, and after 2
minutes begins to alternate light and darkness every minute.

  Players get frags for killing any players on opposite teams.

  The grappling hook has been removed in this level.

  The Engineer has been removed from this map since a sentry in the right spot,
such as pointing towards the spawn drop points, could easily freeze the game. 

  The Thunder1, damage, and pkup sounds we're taken out of the Quake Pak. If
you are playing TeamFortress, you should have them but I included them incase.
The r_item1 sound was taken out of the TF pak. It is also included here incase.
