The Shit Pit - August 1999

by Mog (of TCU)

I couldn't be stuffed making a nice neat text file, as I made the map
itself in 7 hours straight (from 4:30pm till 11:30pm).
Its my...(one...two)...third official TF map, and I spent the least
time on it.  The aim is simply to nab the enemy flag from their base
and dump it on the giant burning turd thats floating in the deadly raw
sewage which separates the two bases.  Its quite small, as with my other
maps, so you'd be best with probably 2 - 6 per team.
ack, its 1:15am now, so I'll get back to TF'n :P
Hope you enjoy the map.
oh yeah, chuck the map in the fortress\maps
and the sounds in fortress\sound\classes
and it will run fine
if you find any bugs, whoopdy doo for you.
