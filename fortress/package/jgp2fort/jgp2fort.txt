JGP2fort v1.0c  map for Team Fortress 2.9                            31/03/2000

It is a map of style 2fort5, but broader and which has like consequence
to force in the center the snipers to supervise a zone of 180 degree. 

I put the triggers for an update easy and fast, if for this map, it would be
necessary to add messages indicating that intrues pass close to the part of the flag. 
These triggers does not function at present in this map, but can be activated easily
if it somebody asks it.
