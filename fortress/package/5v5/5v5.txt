By [SS] Gunther
For the 5v5 Tournament

Special Files:  All sounds go in the effects/asylum directory.
All models (.mdl) go in the fortress/progs directory.

Servers need MegaTF 10.30.98 or better to run this map!
There is no playing difference between 9.24.98 and 10.30.98, only map effects.
So if you're running 9.24.98, update to 10.30.98 or better.
