This is a map designed to be played by two teams.

  Each team has three flags to defend. The objective is to capture
the enemies flags and return them to your base.

  In each base there are several teleporters, which transport you
up onto the catwalk. Only players in there own base can use these
teleporters.

  There is a resupply point in a little corridor just off the centre
room in each base.


How to use this map:
Copy the fast3.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map fast3" (without the quotes)
