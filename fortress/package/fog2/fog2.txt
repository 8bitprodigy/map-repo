* Game info *

This map is a mirror image of capture the flag. Instead of taking 
the flag from the enemy base to yours.. you must take your bomb 
from your base and place it in the enemy ammo dump. Once there 
there is a 5 second countdown until the entire enemy team is killed. 

Your bomb is held in a room just opposite the on-ramp to the sniper 
deck. The bomb will 
remain where it is dropped for 1 minute or until it is picked up by 
another team member. Once you have the bomb you will glow. 
There are two paths to the ammo dump in the base.  
To help defend your base, there is a mounted cannon outside the main
enterance which only the defending team can use. 

Between the two forts i have placed some new obstacles to help players
avoid those damned snipers... Also, there is a water tunnel linked
between two blast craters in the floor. This way avoids nearly all the 
points snipers can see, but it's dark down there and slower characters will
be hard pressed to get out without taking any damage from drowning.
