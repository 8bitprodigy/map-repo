First and foremost me. With out whom this map would not have been
possible.

Then all the cool people I know that have made TF so much
fun over the last 2 years.

//Stuff

It's capture the flag. There is one flag. Many paths to get it to the
cap point. Spawns and ammo spread about the level.
