Release Notes:You take the flag from the enemy's flag room
(you can't enter your flag room) Then you take it back to
your base and up to upper sniper loft (into the door directly
to the left when coming into base, then on the right teleporter)
Repeat as necessary

Also, this map WILL be converted to Quake2 when TF2 comes out
