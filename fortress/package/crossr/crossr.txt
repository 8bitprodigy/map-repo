Details: This map is pretty basic as you can see, since this is the first version there have been no
         other changes to anything from previous version, because there have been none.

	- 2 Backpacks for each team close to each other's bases make it fairly easy to resupply.

	- 4 Teamspawns per team help keep telefragging down to a minimum even with 32 players on the map.

	- Grappling Hooks enabled to get to places where stairs and elev. aren't available.

	  (Everything else in the map is pretty much self-explanitory.)
