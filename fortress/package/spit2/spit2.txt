Description             : TeamFortress Quake Map,
						  			  
	  		: You will find your opponents flag on the top floor
			  of their base, once you have it run like the clappers
			  back to your base and drop off the flag. To drop off
			  the flag, head for the main hall, up the steps,
			  across the small bridge, then through the door on the walkway,
			  down the side ramps and around the wall, there you will find a
			  stone on the floor stand on that to drop the flag.

Changes since
last release		: The map Spit was hated by a lot of people due to the easily defended bottle neck going 			  to the flag room. I have taken it uppon myself to add to this map and make it more 			 	  playable. I got in contact with Ph0n, the creator (long since lost to EverQuest), and 			  he gave me permission along with the original .map file.

			  I have currently added a new route into the flag room, accessable though a hall I added 			  in the boxes in the ramp room. This will take you through some a bunch of jive into the      			  flagroom from the right side.

		 	  A new respawn was added in the empty room that over looks the main entrance, and in 			  	  turn the respawn next to the flag room was turned into a simple resupply.

    			  These new additions should make the map I like the most alot more playable for people 			  	  who haven't liked it in the past.

			  Thank you to everyone who gave me some ideas. If any one runs a respectable server and 			  would like to throw the final version into the map rotation, please do, I'd really 			  	  appreciate it. 21911132.
