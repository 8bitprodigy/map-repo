* Acknowledgments *
My clan Legion of Destruction for helping me test it out quite a bit. Especially
Butthead, Chaos, and War Machine. Thanks to VenoMCuRe for his extesnsive 
technical nit picking (in otherwords...hey LB you realize that...you know if
you...or that if...and I noticed...*fwap*...what's that VenoMCuRe I can't hear
you with that trout in your mouth...). 

* Misc Information *
There is a single train running between the two bases underneath them. I've found
that it creats some *interesting effects* at times. But hell, it's fun to ride.
I haven't been able to test this out with a ton of people playing it yet so 
it's to be seen just how good it works out. One note: if your on the train with
a team mate...I suggest not moving around a lot. :) There is a switch that activates
a set of bars that closes in the flag area. Keeping whoever is in there in but it
also keeps people out. The bars stay down for 30 seconds and can only be activated
once every two minutes. So use it wisely. One final note. I did not get the idea 
for the train from border1. Truck doesn't equal train. I never even saw or really
knew of border1 until 2 weeks before I completed this map. Someone told me it's
been out for some time and I think they are lying since I never noticed it
before they told me about it. I blame it on all servers out there running 
nothing but 2fort something. But hey...that's just one man's opinion. If you
must know I got the idea for it from town2. I thought the subway in there was
pretty damn cool. Though you couldn't ride it. Unless you count getting carried
into the wall and getting crushed riding.

* To the server operators *
If anyone happens to run this map on a server please e-mail me and let me 
know. Just call me the curious one.

* Other * 
If you have any comments or opinions you would like to voice drop me a line 
at my e-mail address given up top. Plus if you are going to criticize...do it
constructively. You'll get a better response out of me that way. If you notice
any major flaws let me know. I'm sure if I think of enough better ways to do
things I'll release another version. So if you want something changed let me 
know and I *may* listen to you if your idea is good.
