                        : deathmatch demo of Thresh vs Entropy on E1M2.

Thanks to               : Id, The guys at TeamFortress, Raistlin for the cool EntEd,
                        : My brother Neil (Lucifer) and friends Chris, Lyndon, Russ
                        : and Bernie (my chief playtesters)

* Game play *
This is a standard 2 team, 2 flag TeamFortress CTF level. Each team has a flag in their
flag room which they have to defend. They must also capture the enemy's flag and bring it
back to their own flag room and deposit it behind their flag (walk through the teleporter).
Your team will get 10 points for successfully depositing the enemy flag in your flag room.
There is a water grate that can be opened/closed by detpacks (stolen idea from Well6)
leading into both flag rooms, and a secret door into the column room (where the 
spawn rooms are next to).

* Map History *
This map started life based on my brother Neils old doom deathmatch level (sorry,
can't remember the name). The oustide area between the team bases was kept open (and
fairly basic) to keep the speed up for the mass battles that usually happen there).
I am not too sure how this will run on a Quakeworld server due to how many players
that could possibly be in the same area together. Maybe someone could let me know
if they decide to use it on a server so I could find out.

* My Other Maps *
tf_attdef  : My first map ever! (and it shows :)
             A TF map designed for attack and defend with 2 teams
mbase_tf   : A 2 team TF map with 2 identical bases seperated by a large body of water.
             One of the first TF maps to use coloured textures to identfy the base that
             you are in.
massivTF   : My third map and first (released anyway) using the way-cool editor Worldcraft.
             This map is huge, I encountered the Quake map limits whilst designing this map.
             2 large bases seperated by an outside area with extensive waterways going into
             each base.
hexTF      : 2 Team, 1 flag idea. Get the flag from the middle into the ENEMYs base to get the
             points. I personally don't like this idea now, but let me know if you do :)
2evil1f    : (see below)

* Other Info *
There is also a 1 flag version of this map (2evil1f).
The single flag starts mid-way between both bases and each team must get the flag into
their own flag room and defend it. The longer it is in their flag room, the more points
and frags their team gets. The other team must capture this flag and place it in their
flag room.

If you like this level mail the server operators and let them know.

Any comments/suggestions/ideas welcome.

* How to use this map *
