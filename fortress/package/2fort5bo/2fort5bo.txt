Details:

This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2.6+.
Gameplay:

You'll have to take the Detpack-Bomb in the middle of the bridge
between the two forts an drop it in the enemy fort
on 4 positions marked by flags.
After done this work you (or a teammate) must release
them by pressing the button appearing on the old
capturepoint.
Each drop gets you 5 frags, the detonation 25.
The enemy will get -10 frags and -50 health
by bombing their fort (when he is is there).
Enemys outside will only get half damage.
Any player in enemy-fort who is not an enemy
(YOU :) ) will also get half damage (25)!

You can use this map :
-on servers with teamplay switched on
-on servers with teamplay switched off. (it's scoring like Teamplay)
