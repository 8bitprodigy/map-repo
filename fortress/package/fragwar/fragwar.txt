* Acknowledgments *
Thanks to Vortex and Butthead for helping me look at the map and test it out
a bit and look for errors and such things. I had fun kicking their asses... =P
If you think that this map favors one class over another blame them cause they
thought I made it balanced quite well. 

* Misc Information *
This map has no flag or goal item right now and may never have one. It's basically
a TF map for frags only...(geez LB is that why you named it fragwar?) It started
out as a normal TF map but in the midst of it all Vortex, Butthead, and I decided
we were going to start a 4 on 4 league. Frags only! So this map was in progress
at the time and I thought it would work quite well for the league so it reached
it's current form. The map was really like 95% done already and it just happen to 
work out real well for what we wanted. So obviously I wouldn't try running this map
with a lot of people on it since it was designed for a 4 on 4 league. There are
lots of options and hiding spots and such fun things to make this map quite
interesting. Plus the grappling hook was left in this map so it makes things 
even more interesting. 

* To the server operators *

If you have any comments or opinions you would like to voice drop me a line 
at my e-mail address given up top. Plus if you are going to criticize...do it
constructively. You'll get a better response out of me that way. If you notice
any major flaws let me know. At some point I *may* complete this map as a normal
TF map since that was it's original intention but I haven't decided yet. We'll 
see how it goes over in it's current form then decide.
