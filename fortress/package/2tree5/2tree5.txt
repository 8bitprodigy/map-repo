			  if you try my map, give me your opinion, good or bad. I want
			  to know if it's just perfect, if I could improve something 
			  or if I just have to stop making levels. Thanks in advance.

Summary of changes from previous version: 2tree45:
-There is 2 lifts in the well room to go to the room above. They're for both teams but only one way.
-Some textures here and there have been enhanced.
-The capture is now 10 points for everybody. The older version was cooler but to buggy.
-There is more room behind the pyramids.
-You can no longer exit from the map, behind the red pyramid.
-The tree before the red mirador has been lowered so that reds can jump on it like blues.
================================================================

* Play Information *

It's a 2team-flag capture map. The flag is easy to found. You captureit in the room behind the red portal 
for reds and behind the two blue columns for the blues. In the second entrances to the bases.
When you capture, the block under the drop off point opens and there is a magic ball inside. 

You can swim to the flag but first you have to blow off the door that's in the first 
room after the water corridor (detpack the computer next to the door).
There is a laser barrier just after. It won't hurt you but it alerts the
enemies that you are coming. There is no way to shut it down. You can't dive back 
from the flag in the water, but you can do it in the well. There is a grate that opens
with the button next to it. It's a toggle door. So you can open it when you come, get the 
flag and then dive to swim your way back to your base. The grate next the pyramid can also be detpacked.

There is a regenerator in the first room. They will work for each team, 
but they are very noisy, so don't plan to do half the way, have a rest in enemies base 
and then go for the flag, but you can stop a few seconds to recover some life.

Design:	 	I keeped the outside area of my first map cause I found it nice. It's huge 
		and highly detailed so you shouldn't run my map on a 286SX!
		That's why it took 7 HOURS! to vis. (standards light and qbsp times) 
		The bases are similar but still different. Architecture is basically 
		the same, but design is different and here and there you can found a stair
		instead of a lift.
		You like the flag room model? It's an idea of lolo.@bluewin.ch (Thanks lolo!) I never 
		saw a model before so if someone already did it, thanks for the idea too.
