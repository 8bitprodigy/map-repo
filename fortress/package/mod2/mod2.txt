Construction

Base:           Sniprwar
Editor:         Worldcraft
Known Bugs:      When entering the base and turning left, you have to jump.  Under that stoop is 
a grey spot.  Of you aim at that grey spot, wherever you are standing your gun sight will stay.
There is also a func_wall on the top of the blue's sniper nest.  At a certain place and angle 
it will appear invisible.
Build Time:     15 hours
Test Time:   3 hours


==============================================================================
Little Background and then some.

Ok, this is the first map I have edited.  I am unable to make my own as of late.  I hope
to come out with a demoman war though.  Just as soon as I learn some more stuff.  Anyway, this
is just like the normal sniprwar with a few modifications.  

1.  You have full access to both bases or forts.
2.  Walls divide the playing field but are split in the middle.
3.  Only one way in, one way out.
4.  No flags.  Purely KILL, KILL, KILL.


I also plan to either edit this one or make a new one with all the classes enabled.  Just as soon 
as I figure out how to do that.  If you know how please let me know at brain1@innocent.com


Special thanks to the following people:

[MG] Scorpion (Creator of Qdeth2 and 3) for his patience with me and my annoying questions.
ID for making Quake
Creators of Team Fortress
Worldcraft Creators
Myself for trying to do this.

Shoutouts:

Virus
PartyPooper
Zoom (former clan leader)
Doom Squad (clan)
Torn Limb (clan)
Rod (helped me with my Quake server)
Clan Kavorkian for Mega-TF

Opinion:
I would just like to say that those Quake players out there who just play maps and don't think
about the time it took to make it, you have no idea.  It is very hard to do these maps.
Until you actually sit down and try to do it you really have no idea how hard it is.  Anyway, I 
would just like to congratulate all the map creators and to keep up the good work.  You 
certainly earn a place in Quake's hall-of-fame.
