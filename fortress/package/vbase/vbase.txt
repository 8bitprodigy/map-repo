  This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team has their own base,
at opposite ends of the map.

  The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and capture the enemy
flag. The flag must then be returned to the top of their building.

There are 2 resupply points on each base.
  
N.B. The grappling hook has been removed in this level.
