 High Detailed 2forts style map.  Flags are located deep within the enemy 
citadel.  Good visibility (some ppl hate this) provides more efficient use 
sentry guns and snipers.  2 ways into the enemy fort -- through the sewage
system and throught the front doors, although the sewage system will prove 
to be worthless to hwguys and soldiers (maybe next version ill add some more 
air holes), the only air pocket is right under the enemy respawn door, i 
assumed this would be the most frequently occupied location so the enemy 
would hear you going up for air.  There is an alternate way to the rr, but 
access is restricted to grenade/pipe/rocket jumpers (guard this place well).  This 
passageway is also an excellent way out for the enemy flag carrier, but 
can be closed off for 15 seconds, but then can be used again after half a 
minute.  Bring the enemy flag to your cap point on your sniper tower and
recieve 7 seconds of quad damage, which could lead to some co-ordinated caps.
