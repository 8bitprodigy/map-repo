Details:
--------

Cybervalhalla or the First Circle Of Hell ... You decide. 2 opposing Sides of Undead Warriors 
battle it out for the Holy Runes located deep within each Side's Realm. 

This is a medium-sized CTF map that was designed with Teamplay and Strategy in mind. 
Your Goal is to take the Enemy Holy Rune and capture it in the middle of your Main Hall.


- There are 2 Realms, facing each other across the Central Hub (featuring Water1.2 <tm>), each 
  having 3 ways in and 2 ways out.
 - You Respawn in a pretty uncampable Haven, cherrish it - you can't return until you die.
 - Then comes your Main Hall, the main Crossroad in your Realm. Shoot the button to start the 
   Elevator (you can also start the enemy Elevator, just takes time & aiming). Go down for 
   Supplies. The Holy Water heals you and damages the Enemy. Find the Illusionary Wall for 
   some Goodies and a nice Sentry spot. There are some Supplies (for both Sides) down at the 
   Water Entrance.
 - The Sniper Bunker is behind the door near the Main Entrance. This fast-closing door can be 
   opened only by a friendly sniper. The deck itself lies in complete darkness. This favors 
   llamas who use whiteskins, but since most 'good' snipers do, the odds should be even. Use your
   flares if you get scared ..
 - A Bridge spans the Central Hub (also known as Yard). It directly connects both Realms.
 - The Lower Entrance (below the Bridge) takes you up the Spiral Staircase to the Side Entrance 
   of the Main Hall.
 - And finally there is a WindTunnel that takes you from the water straight to the enemy 
   Rune Sanctuary. Use it! It can be opened by an Engineer, a Detpack or a HWGuy-Saw and
   stays open for 2 minutes. You can also exit the water in the Hub near one of 
   the Lower Entrances.

Hell Awaits!
Have Fun :)
