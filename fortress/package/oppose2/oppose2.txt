* Game Play *

If you know Oppose1 then you know how to play this map.
A couple of new things added:
1) There is a water entrance now. You need a Demoman to Detpack the rock wall and
   then an Engineer to open the door. NOTE: ANY Engineer can open/close the door.

2) The capture point is now in the centre of the map. Go to the rooftop of your
   base and step onto the upraised square to teleport to the centre.

3) Security system!!! The boards throughout the base informs you of intruders. Make
   it harder for Spies, but it means they have to be more clever :)

4) pakx.pak in the zip. This replaces the 2nd swamp sound with a waterfall sound.
   Simply put it in either quake/id or quake/fortress and rename it to the next pak
   file required (ie. If you have pak0.pak and pak1.pak, rename pakx.pak to pak2.pak)

 * Q&A *

1. Why Oppose?

I've always liked the layout of Oppose. Sure it has it's bugs (Armour and getting
stuck being the main ones), but I feel it still is a good map and decided to
'rework' it in an attempt to fix those problems. I feel I've done the job quite
well :)

2. Why the name 'We Need A Plumber'?

Mainly due to all the waterfalls in the bases. There has to be a leak in the plumbing
somewhere right!?! Or, if you prefer the totally made up lie, it's dedicated to all 
those map builders making a map that's leaky as my kitchen sink and are attempting
to remove them as you read this file.

3. Who made what?

Rip made Oppose1 and since Oppose2 is very close to the original, the credit still
goes to Rip. The credit that I'll be borrowing (stealing? ;) is for reworking the
style of the map and the parts that I added (primarily the water entrance).

So look at it that way, I have the credit for the redo and water entrance, the rest
belongs to Rip :)

 * Version Info *

Beta 1
======

Initial Release


Beta 2
======

* Fixed doors sliding into other areas. (Front doors and lower respawn door)
* Fixed red capture point so it works.
* Fixed messages so that it says 'flag' instead of 'sword'.
* Made it so it teleports you rather than kills you near the flag capture point.
* Minor texture problems fixed.

Release 1
=========

* Added drop point from upper balcony.
* Minor texture problems fixed.
* Removed problem brushes.
* Entity Update.

 * Final Words *

I took my time making the damn thing, with moving, visiting inter-state and general
life interupting me. I'm glad I've finished it and I quite like how it turned out
and I hope you do too.

Please Email me with any suggestions, Bugs etc , Thanks.
