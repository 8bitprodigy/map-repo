The door to a key remains open, after it have opened first time.
It is made what the key, after returning, was not pressed down by
this door. Because of it bug earlier the key could not be taken more.
Can be, this bug could be corrected somehow differently...
But I shall be given, that my method not less effective :).

In backpacks in respawn rooms it is put red armor. Now
medics and engineers will not be defective classes on this map.

here's the readme from it, with a few updates:

This is a revision of Millenium Bases, updated to remove the 
lift/flag bug the original suffered from - during a game, if
a key carrier was killed while suffering packetloss on the water
entrance lift, the key would drop through the lift. Anyone 
trying to pick up the key would assume it was resting on top of
the lift and try to pick it up from there. Unless someone goes
underneath the lift when its activated and picks the key up,
when the key returns to the keyroom, nobody can pick it up for 
the remainder of the game.
I have no idea if this is a TF code bug, or a QW bug (/me glares
at Zoid) but whatever the reason, its obviously not acceptable
in a match situation :)
To fix it, I altered the lift supports so that it's no longer
possible to go underneath the lift when it's risen. This
arguably takes away some gameplay elements from the water
entrance area, but there isn't much else I can do with the 
current releases of QW and TF being as they are.
Thanks to Goff for pointing out the bug.

==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress CTF style map based on *cough* Bases.bsp.
Since there are so many 2forts clones (and even the occasional
well6 clone), I thought I'd attempt to update the one map that
actually NEEDS updating :)

Map features (compared with the original Bases):

- Wider, less cramped corridors
- No gren2 resupply packs to reduce spam
- Sniper towers are properly lit now ;)
- No protruding edges in the middle of walls
- Resupply packs give red armour for Soldiers and HWGuys
- All ramps wider and shallower for smoother movement
- Higher ramproom and keyroom ceilings
- Less sky outside to reduce lag in GL
- Lower water entrance overhead walkway (its now possible to
  rocket jump from the water entrance floor to the walkway)
- Buggy wind tunnel from entrance floor to ramproom replaced
  with a (working) lift
- Glowing key models (The original uses b_s_key.mdl and
  b_g_key.mdl which means unless you have flag emulation, the
  keys are hard to see when dropped)
- Detpackable cap point feature 'improved' (see gameplay below)
- Keyroom rearranged to make a bit more room for fighting
  instead of the usual cramped panicky spamming :)

I decided not to change the basic layout too drastically,
because I still believe it works well for teams of 6-8 a side,
which as far as I'm concerned is the ideal size for tf games -
any more and 99% of maps become crowded fragfests, with no room
for the more subtle tactics which make tf so challenging and 
dagnammit, fun, to play :)
Thats not to say the map is no good for the usual 9-12 a side
matches that it gets used for in the UKTFL, WPTFL, IGL etc -
it's still better than the original Bases thanks to the wider
corridors and bigger ramps and flag rooms, etc.
Think of it as evolution rather than revolution or sommat :)

Scoring works as follows:

- 10 team points and 10 team frags per enemy key capture
- 5 frags for every team member (but no points) every time
  the enemy computer is damaged
- -10 (yes, as in 'minus ten') frags for trying to
  capture the enemy key when your computer is damaged.
  Pay attention next time :P

To capture the enemy key, take it from the enemy keyroom to
your own and place it in the computer there. Upon doing this,
all medics on your team receive 100 medikits while all
engineers receive 100 cells.
To damage the enemy computer, place a detpack just in front of
it on the platform. A demoman doing this gets a full resupply
of ammo and health, as well as 4 gren1s.
To repair your computer in order to continue capping, get an
engineer to stand on the cap point and they'll reactivate it.
[Update: the backpacks in the respawn now give out EMP grenades
every now and then.]

=========================Misc. Info=============================

Thanks to the artist formerly known as [EQ]Babs for helping test
the various fucked up ents. He'll probably have finished his
first map by the time you end up reading this, and its looking
rather good at the moment.
[Update: he accidentally deleted it at a lan meet. The eejit.]
Thanks also to a certain Tibetan hooved mammal for providing me
with much amusement due to his inability to actually finish any 
of his f'in maps :)
[Update: llama actually managed to release 2fortSE, to have it
awarded best new map in an unofficial poll of UK TFers, despite
it being nearly a year old or something... nice one Lee :)]
Finally, thanks to The University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology for providing me with my internet 
connection for the last 2+ years (muahahah).

Tata.
