======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map designed for up to 3 players on 2 different
teams. There are no flags on this map, and therefore no way to gain
frags other than killing the opponent.

There are 2 teams to this map. 
The blue team fights up to 3 on 3 with the red team.

The Objective is to kill the opponent more than the opponent kills you.

POINT SYSTEM:
Normal frag scoring:
Blue Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody
Red Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody

their support in my mapmaking abilities.
