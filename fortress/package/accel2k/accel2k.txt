======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a four team TeamFortress CTF map.

There are 4 teams to this map, team 1 (blue), team 2 (red), team 3 (yellow) and team 4 (green). Each base consists of one very small two-leveled fort, situated above a pool of bubbling slime. There are four platforms which move to the center and back to your base - using these you can get entry to enemy bases, and enemys can get entry to yours. If the server you are playing on has the Grappling Hook enabled, you will be able to "Grapple" your way over to the other base as well! There are also other ways to get between bases. Be creative.

In the center of the map on a small floaty platform is a megacharge. This will give you 25 seconds of invulnerability. In each base on the lower level is one backpack, which dispenses ammo, armour and health.

Each team must retrieve enemy flags from either of the enemy bases to score. Instead of there being a single flag in the center of the map, each team now has their own flag to defend, and hence three flags to capture. Your flag is kept on a coloured pedestal on the upper deck of your base. Defend this! Don't let any players from other teams even get near it! There is another white pedestal on your upper deck. This pedestal is your "capture point", so called because you "capture" enemy flags here (d'oh!). This is how your team scores points - a player from your team must infiltrate either of the enemy bases, grab their flag, and somehow get home in one piece, then cap the flag at the cap point.

!!!!!! SERVER ADMINS !!!!!!

For the best gameplay of this map, the Grappling Hook needs to be ON. It can be off if other maps need it like so, but it's best with it on.

POINT SYSTEM:

All teams: 2 frags & team score for a captured flag for the whole team, with an
additional 2 frags (making 4 frags) for the guy who actually captured it.

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

This map is based on the design of accel by Gjermund Jensvoll. I have been unable to get in contact with him as the e-mail addy in the accel readme is out of date (The original was made in Janurary '97. I'm guessing he is not involved in any TF stuff any more).
