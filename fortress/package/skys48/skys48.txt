THANK YOU's : I would like to Imaginos {SK} for helping me with the TF entities.
	Without him I would still be looking at a wireframe model of my map saying
	"huh....it looks like it might be fun. Now what the hell do I do?...." I
	would also like to thank Chronic {ATF} for helping me by supplying me with
	a temp server to check my level once it was done (or close to). More thanks to
	Floogy, Magnum {GP}, and Babe -N- Toyland {GP} for keeping me awake early in
	the mornings while I compiled skys42 and for just being there. Thank you
	to RAMPAGE who brought the flag return error to my attention. THANKS to all
	of you.  P.S.- Although	the map name "Wrath of Crackle" is funny to us Magnum,
	I would hate to have to tell people why we named it that over and over ;-)For
	those of you who feel you should have been mentioned here...uhhhhh....well...
	Thank you too I guess.

**You must have Quake and the proper TF files to play this level.**

Singleplayer: you could, but why would you want to? There are no monsters.
Cooperative: not really, I had very little cooperation making it so why
	should you have any?
Teamfortress: You betcha!
New sounds: NO
New graphics: NO
New music: NO
(HEY!! What do you expect...It is my FIRST map.)

**Construction**

Based on: From scratch.
Editors: Worldcraft (nice program), EntEd (also nice), and the TF entities
	patch by Imaginos.
Known Bugs: some textures aren't aligned properly (cosmetic bug, nothing more), 
Build time: about a week or two I guess (not nonstop silly!!)

***Playing Info***

This is a capture the flag map. Red's base is the roof and Blue's is the basement.
One of the only maps I know of where the two bases are not identical or mirror
images ;-) There are stairwells in each corner.There are also elevators (blue = up,
green = down) (note: green elevators need to be hit to descend) but there is
no roof/basement access from them. Flags should be brought to your teams flag to score.
The enemy team CAN enter you resupply rooms but they can NOT resupply there. Just
a warning! The 3 floors between the roof and basement are very close fighting quarters
and could potentially create some nice wars. Plus for you scouts out there there are
plenty of nooks and cranys to 'lose enemies' in in the middle floors.  = )
When I envisioned this map in my mind I wanted more detail and larger rooms but for
the sake of game-play-ability (i.e. lag in big areas, etc) I have 'quit' where it is
now. Hopefully even HPBs will be able to enjoy this map. Please send suggestions and
comments to my E-mail or via ICQ. They would be much appreciated. This is my first
attempt at creating a map for any game so please be gentle ;-). If I recieve any good
ideas I may incorporate them into skys46 if I decide to update/fix it. Also, in the
event that I make another map your comments could come in handy.


BUGS FIXED:

From version skys46:
1)some texture misalignments that were too obvious were fixed
2)The Flag doesn't remove itself from the game if it goes untouched for 20 seconds!!
	SORRY ABOUT THAT ONE!!
