Revision 4
-----------

So many things and problems fixed I don't even want to think about it.

Revision 3
-----------

I added a water passage into each base from under the bridge. It
comes up on two sides of the ramproom in the corners under
the ramps.

I also re-did the ramps to make them sleeker. Still need a little
fixing that I'll do if I have to fix/add something else too.

Revision 2
-----------

I changed the backpacks to give red armor. I also fixed some of the
sayings, and added another sniper area.

Revision 1
-----------
This is an ordinary "Capture The Flag" style TeamFortress Map. 

There are two teams, Blue, and Red. Each start in their own building, and
must get across the bridge into the enemy base, go up the ramps in the
ramproom, turn left or right, go up to the left tower, and get
the flag. Bring it back to your right tower, and cap

The Flag Area on each base is in the left tower (lookin at base) or right tower
(looking inside base). It is up at the top of the tower, accessible only by
ramps.

The Capture Area on each base is in the right tower (lookin at base) or left
tower (looking inside base). It is up at the top of the tower, accessible only
by ramps.

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and
all my clanmates that urged me to finish this map and get it working. Also
some thanks to the entities added into 2fort5, which i used to help mine.
Also some thanks to Someone, who told me how to get this working in GLQuake.
And finally, to everyone that tested each new revision of the map, and helped
me get it bug free.. Chizad, Hexxer, Zombie, Fedex.. and more. Thanks.
