* Game info *

Put the HS1_2.bsp and this txt file in your quake\fortress\maps directory.

Simple game play.  Team 1 tries to stay alive and Team 2 tries to kill
team 1.  The longer a player on Team 1 lives the more frags they get.
Max of 4 players on Team 1.  No limit on Number of players on Team 2.

For every 30 seconds that a member of Team 1 stays alive after going 
through the teleporter the team gets 2 frags.

For every member of Team 1 that gets killed, Team 2 gets 5 frags.
