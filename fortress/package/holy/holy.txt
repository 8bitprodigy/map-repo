WARNING: This map contains light-hearted religious overtones that are NOT
         meant to be taken seriously!
I have never seen a map which has the player say something when they start
that differs depending on their class, so here is one that DOES!

I have just started a new map, WARZONE (working title).  It is going to be
as good as I can possibly make it, so PLEASE contact me with your ideas on
making the perfect TF map! (so far my ideas include a power plant, trench
warefare, APC's, Helecopters, Airstrikes (when you cap) and anti-aircraft
missile batteries (disarm these if you want the airstrike to work...)
Hopefully the Quake engine will be good enough to make all this a reality...

Thank you for getting my map, but remember, no-one likes it when you alter
their work without their permission! Please let this map remain as it is,
unless I give you permission
