=========================Revision Info.=========================
The Pentagram time has been reduced to 1 second at a time. this is 
to reduce the chances of having a invincible medic running around 
infecting people. If you get thrown in jail and you have the grail. 
The grail will be returned it it's alter. I also reduced the quad
damage you get from capping the grail, from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.

==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a TeamFortress CTF 2fort5 style map but medieval. If you
Know 2fort5 you know this map. This map is kind of the best of 
2fort5r.bsp, well6.bsp and rock.bsp

There are two teams to this map. Red and Blue Each has a base
Clearly marked with Cerberus's 3-headed dragon. I sometimes play
Auto team so I marked each castle and resupply room with that teams
Color. This way if you pick auto team you will know what team you
Are on as soon as you spawn.


Each base has an outside sniper deck that is only accessible from
Outside and the elevator leading to it works for both teams. (like
In well6.bsp) the map has a jail cell and teleporters like the rock 
& The Rock2. If you try to enter the enemies resupply rooms you will
Be stripped of all ammo and grenades and thrown in jail. There is
Where I differ from The Rock. Once in jail you will be given the 666
Pentagram. This keeps the enemy from getting a cheap frag, and makes
it in your teams best interest to bust you out. The cell door can 
only be opened by a member of your team. This way a dumbass enemy
can't let you out. If you have the flag when you get thrown I jail
you keep it. This is even more incentive for team mates to bust you
out.

Once you cap the Grail your team will get 10 seconds of quad. This
is your reward for getting your grail out of the enemies hands.
