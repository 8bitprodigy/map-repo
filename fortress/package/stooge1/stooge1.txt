Special Thanks          : Clan TsB for thier help in debuging my map and putting up with me.  NCNJ's server
                          admin Morgan for putting my map up (one hell of a guy).

*Game play*
#1 - I put in a loft for a sentry near the flag (engineers have fun).
#2 - A camouflage loft is in the basement for snipers.
#3 - I left one hell of an expanse in the basement (with a sort of a maze thrown in) for fraging to your
     hearts content.
#4 - The two bridges are a little narrower on purpose because if a member from each team tries to cross it
     someone is bound to die (exception to the rule might be a MegaTF Airscout who can jump over you).
#5 - I used the same texture in the basement to make camouflage easier and I picked that color so
     sentries can be seen easier.
---------
#6 - There are killer fish in the water if this map is used on a MegaTF server.
---------
#7 - All respawn rooms have TEAM SENSITIVE DEATH FIELDS in them (respawn camping will not work on this map).
