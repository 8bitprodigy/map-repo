Description             : A two team TF map.  One flag:-) The flag is
                          positioned in the center of the map.  Either
                          team can take it.  Once the flag is taken, the
                          team who has it, keeps it until the flag carrier
                          is killed.  Scoring is completed by taking the
                          flag to your well within your fort for 5 team frags
                          or the enemies fort for 15 team frags.
                          This map puts each team into total commitment, If
                          your team has the flag..u defend your carrier, if not
                          then attack the enemy's fort and kill the bugger so your
                          team can control the flag.
                          This is a fairly small map...lots of frag potential:-)
