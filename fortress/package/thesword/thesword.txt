======================= Game Play ======================== 
To Score on this map you must capture the sacred sword in the temple, with the power of this
ancient artifact you will become King of all the realm.  The team who has the King will score
points the longer the King stays alive.  Remember there can only be ONE King.

You can also steal the enemys Taxes from there strong room and return them to the Throne in your
own castle to score points.


POINT SYSTEM:
10 Frags for Becoming King.
3 Team points for every Minute your team has the King.
20 Points for The team and 10 frags for the Individual who steals the Taxes.


NOTES ON GAMEPLAY:	- The King will glow. And should receive 50 health from the sword.
			- The King can't go undercover.

			- The Tax Strong Room need a key to enter, and dont say there to long or
			  You will get locked, but only if you pick up the Taxes.			
			- NO, messages will be broadcast concerning the Tax box, you'll only be
			  Told after it's been stolen. It is stealing, so when it's there
			  keep an eye out for thieves, espeicaly for spys.		
			- The tax box will uncover spys, but they can go back undercover.
			- You move at half speed when carrying the heavy Taxes.


			- The Portcullis of each Castle can be open and closed by the switch in 
			  the room above the floor grate.
			- Keep an Eye out for the Secrets.

NOTE ON MEMORY REQUIRMENTS:
The file size of this level is quite large so it won't run with
standard Quake 8mb data heap. (This is fairly typical of TF maps)
You'll need to use the switch -winmem to give quake more mem, 16mb recommended.
Or use WinQuake, with its dynamic mem alloc.
Quakeworld users shouldn't have a problem.
