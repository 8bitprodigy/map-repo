pipeline.bsp            : Map file (see below for instructions).
pipeline.txt            : The text file you are reading now, DUH!

* Game play *
This is a unique map set up like so: Team 1, The Gaurdians gaurd their secret
weapon (The Thunderbolt, which is locate on the bottom floor) from Team 2, 
The Raiders.  The Raiders start on the roof and must infultrate the building,
sieze the Secret Weapon and return to the roof to get 7 frags for their team.
The Gaurdians have a tactical advantage because they just need to sit on 
their asses and gaurd but there is no enemy flag for them to capture.  I 
think this should even out pretty good.

*Stuff you should know about this map*
This is (as you probably know) an experimental idea, i think it will even out
pretty good but I dunno for sure.  So if it sucks IM SORRY but at least I
tryed something new!  And also dont judge all my maps by this one, im sure
future maps will be nothing like this one.

* My Other Maps *
Ill probably be releasing a whole crap load of maps (hopefully for Quake 2
mostly).  But Ill probably at least make the level "Hell" for my clan The 
Elder Gods of Hell for Quake 1.
