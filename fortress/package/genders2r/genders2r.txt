genders2 by -I-J.Killer
genders2r ent revision by Arc (6 Jan 2024)

The yard spawn in the original genders2 causes disagreements in attack v. defend games about yard DM etiquette.

The yard spawn has therefore been moved to the grate tunnel.

The probability of getting the grate spawn is the same as the former yard spawn (5/14 or 35.7%).

You can still detpack the grate for 2 team points.
