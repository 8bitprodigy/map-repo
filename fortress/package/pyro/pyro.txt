======================== Game Play ========================== 

 This map is different from most TF maps in that there isn't
 a flag for each team which the other team has to capture.
 There are five 'fires' on this map, which look like the
 flames that the pyro can lay on walls and the ground.

 The fires are to be taken to the middle of your team's base.
 The teamscores indicate how many fires each team has.  The
 map ends after one team gets all five of the fires.

 There is also a timer that ends the map after 10 minutes.
 Since this is a fairly small map, I do not expect it to take
 long to finish.  Most people would get bored after about 10
 minutes anyway.

==================== Copyright Notices ======================

 None really.  Just do whatever you want with it.
