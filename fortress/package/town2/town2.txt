Release Notes:
This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Gold" map.

There are 3 teams to this map.  The Cops who are protecting the gold, the Robbers who
are trying to steal the gold and the Gang members who are around to protect their "turf".

To capture the gold, the Robbers must take the bag of gold to their getaway truck. As an
added bonus, the Cops can receive frags for attacking the inside of the truck.

Enjoy, and be careful not to get hit by the train!
