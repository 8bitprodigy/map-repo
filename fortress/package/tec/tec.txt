==About==

hmm.. well this is a QW MegaTF map.

Its got colored lighting support and MegaTF entities so its best to run with a MegaTF server.
To utilize the colored lighting get a client that supports it. Currently the two major ones are MoreQuake and QuakeForge. I recomend Quakeforge for newbies but if you know how to read a readme.txt then try MoreQuake.

==Installation==

tecbases.bsp goes into your quake/fortress/maps directory
tecbases.lit goes into your quake/fortress/maps directory
flagtaken.wav goes into your quake/fortress/sound directory
flagcapture.wav goes into your quake/fortress/sound directory
kup.wav goes into your quake/fortress/sound/weapons directory

If you just extract the zip into your quake directory it should be ok.

==bugs==
Well, the kup.wav sound is a sound from quake3. Its used on the backpacks.. it was suposed to be just a sound from quake but mispelled it in the entity field so i decided to add a new sound with the misspelled name rather then spend another day compileing.
