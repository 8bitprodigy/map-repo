* Acknowledgments*
I have to thank the 666th Brigade for helping me test it out. I would 
especially like to thank Bloodlust, vortex, alshman, Some Punk, and Dr. 
Killjoy, all of the 666th Brigade for their time helping me test it. If there 
is a major flaw in something blame them...hehehe

* Misc Information *
This map is quite small and simple but I find it to be a good practice map.
There isn't a ton of textures used either cause this is my first map and was
a learning experience for me. I am currently working on another map that will
be MUCH better but no clue how soon it will be done. This is a very good map
for small battles because there are hiding spots but it isn't so big that you
never see anyone else. If you try running this with more than 16 people you 
have to be insane...but hell...it's your frag fest. This is also obviously 
the second version. The first one had a major problem with the spawn points.
Fixed that plus changed around some of the physical part of the level itself
and added a second supply room.

* To the server operators *
If anyone happens to run this map on a server please e-mail me and let me 
know. Just call me the curious one.

* Other * 
If you have any comments or opinions you would like to voice drop me a line 
at my e-mail address given up top. Just don't be expecting any more versions
of this...it was just a practice run after all. Plus if you are going to 
criticize...do it constructively. You'll get a better response out of me that
way.
