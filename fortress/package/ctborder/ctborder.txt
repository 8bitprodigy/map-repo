======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map.

There are 2 teams,
        1. Border patrol - they kill everyone
        2. Beans (Immigrants) - They try to take the truck and go to
           America.  If they pick up the key on the roof they can have
	   Weapons!! But otherwise they don't have ammo.
        
POINT SYSTEM:

        Every immigrant that makes it to America gets 5 personal frags
        Blue gets frags by killing the Beans, simply.  The Beaner with the
	key can't cross into america, or "Hit the road" so then he gets 
	points by killing Blues.

        For clan matches or tournament play, two rounds should be played.
        Only teamscore counts.
