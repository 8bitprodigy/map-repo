I hoped to change the TF clan offence and defence strategies with this map. 

The flag is guarded by a cage, which will only open when all 4 buttons have been pushed, so defence will have to be spread. Once all the buttons are pushed the cage takes a while to open so defenders or reinforcements can return and kill the opposing threat. But once the cage is opened it cannot be shut and once the flag has moved it wont return.

You get 5 points for every button so even if there isn't a cap the buttons should tell the winner. And 80 frags for the capture of the enemy flag which will equal 100.
