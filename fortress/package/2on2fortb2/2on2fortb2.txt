* Description *

This is a beta, completely playable, no bugs that I'm aware of, except that
sometimes gren2's will go through the floor of the ramp room because it's
such a small map.  Don't know if I'll change anything for any final releases
but this'll do hopefully.

Quite a few people seem to like 1on1fort, but instead of 2 players, they
play with 4-6 players.  So I thought, why not make it a bit bigger, so I
added spirals, lift, respawn rooms, and flag rooms, probably making it good
enough for 3on3's now, but hey, 2on2fort seemed the logical choice in map
name so there ya go heh.  Dunno why, but I wanted to make the lift broken, so
there you have it, just rj out of it heh.
