 Future Plans : There aren't to many for this map in particular. I have already started on 
                my next map, Summer Camp, and it's turning out great. I am also drawing up
                plans for a Scout Training map, similar to the Soldier Rocket-Jump levels.
                3-Man Free For All may get a few light buzzing sounds for the lights, but
                other than that this map is done.
