Base                    This was created before the 2tallforts.bsp, but I didn't know
                        the entities back then, so I revived it becase the concept was
                        good and my nephew and I LAN'd our butts of in a head on confrontation
                        in this map. You see the capture points are both in the same room.
                        They are both set in a kind of underworld eg. sewer :) under the
                        the pool. There is only one entrance "A wind tunnel at the end of
                        the pool"! Half is wind, and half is tunnel w/obstacles.
                          The map also has unseen teleporters placed strategically, and there
                        are also some team_no assigned wind elevators. Never to fear though!
                        All areas with the exception of the ammo dumps is accessable by both
                        teams! If you find a backpack on the opposing side and it doesn't
                        work for you, don't worry it wasn't meant to! {:o)
                           I am 99% I have the bugs in editing squashed, so get in there and 
                        sqaush all the oppose. 
                          I am looking forward to getting my but kicked in this one ONLINE!

Known Bugs              : I don't Know if you would call very minor hangs in the wind tunnels
                          bugs. I think when its the only entrance to a common
                          capture area, it just makes it more interesting:)

* Other Info *
Description: 
                    This is similar to all the rest. you have two forts opposite each
                    other, with a pretty mean snipage setup on the roofs. 
                    I believe in face up confrontation, so get prepared.
                      Steal their flag and head for the pool. More than likely they will
                    be doing the same thing . the way to both capture points is a tunnel
                    at the end of the pool under water. This tunnel empties out in a sewer
                    area for lack of a better word. there is a room there .proceed to your 
                    colored capture pad in the room. there are three teleporters the middle
                    one empties in the main pool. the designated  Red and Blue on either
                    side empty behind there prespective forts. The thing that makes the map
                    is and always has been the players . there is an old saying: A fisherman
                    somtimes fishes a whole lifetime before he figures out that it wasn't
                    really the fish he was after!
                    This map is freeware. Enjoy it and remember if you don't like the map
                     It is not the end of the world. 
          
Installation:      Well! you ought to know by now------fortress/maps=bsp file
                                                       fortress/sound=wav
                                                       and I think the flg.mdl's are just fine
                                                       so I haven't added any, but if I do in the 
                                                       future then it would be:
                                                       fortress/progs=mdl's
                    The wav files you probably already have ,but they are here too!
                    Special thanks to whoever made these wav files. they add to any
                    level!
