This is a revision of Accel2k, updated to fix the first spawn
point when you enter the level (the player kept falling into
the slime) as well as a couple other small updates too
insignificant to mention.

- Voo

If you never downloaded the original Accel2k.zip (shame on you),
here's the readme from it, with a few updates:

==========================Gameplay==============================

This is a four team TeamFortress CTF map.

Each team must defend their flag and base against enemys, and
similarly must attempt to gain entry to enemy bases and steal
enemy flags. Each base consists of one very small two-leveled
fort, situated above a pool of bubbling slime. If the server
you are playing on has the Grappling Hook enabled, you will
be able to "Grapple" your way over to the other base as well!
There are also other ways to get between bases. Be creative.
In the center of the map on a small platform is a megacharge.
This will give you 20 seconds of invulnerability, quad and
invisibility. In each base on the lower level is one backpack,
which dispenses ammo, armour and health. Each team must retrieve
enemy flags from either of the enemy bases to score. Each team
has their own flag to defend, and hence three flags to capture.
Your flag is kept on a coloured pedestal on the upper deck of
your base. Defend this! *Don't* let any players from other teams
even get near it! There is another white pedestal on your upper
deck. This pedestal is your "capture point", so called because
you "capture" enemy flags here (d'oh!). This is how your team
scores points - a player from your team must infiltrate either
of the enemy bases, grab their flag, and somehow get home in
one piece, then cap the flag at the cap point.

Point System:

+2 frags and +2 team score for each capture of an enemy flag.
