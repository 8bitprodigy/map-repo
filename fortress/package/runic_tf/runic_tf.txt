Comments                :I dont think it's that great for tf, but some of the architecture is really nice.
                          I also find it nice to finally have a runic type(using the metal type of textures, like dm2) of tf level, and one with detail.
                         and there is some nice features that I have never seen implemented in a tf map yet...

Build Time      : 
                 Qbsp             :

Texture WAD used:textures.wad 
Editor(s) used  :worldcraft 1.6 reg'd
Known Bugs      :woooo!! this is hard, there is of course some messed up texturing, a little error near the blue flag (somethin i cant figure out), and i forgot to add
a brush in the cage before i did the final compile, u also may get stuck a little in the cage since the brushes were being bitchy and wouldnt line up.
!!!!!Legal Crap!!!!!
ask ME if u ever want to use the map for any pack or somethin like that, and it would be nice to let me know if u are doing an update...
