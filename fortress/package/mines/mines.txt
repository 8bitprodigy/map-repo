This map features 2 opposing teams dug into trenches.  One respawn

sniper tower only accessible by the appropriate team.  The map is
in a nighttime setting and between the trenches is a large minefield
which must be crossed twice to capture the flag.  Spotlights at the
top of each sniper tower are emplaced to light up the battlefield.
Give it a try!
