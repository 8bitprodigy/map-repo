I don't know who made 3way1. 
It has a nice layout but is ugly. 
My goal for 3way2 was to give the map nice textures so it could be taken seriously for 3v3.
There are new arrows to help navigate the hallways easier.
The map needed some minor ent revisions as well.
The flag return time increased from 25 seconds to 40.
Flaginfo works now.
I added a small bump midmap to help with conc jumps.
Textures are mostly from marics_ctf1.
