======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the ammo and destroy Hitlers Clone" map.

This is a small map for those like myself who can only find a few people to play with on the Companies LAN. 
You could play with a bunch of guys on this but it was intended for lunchtime work frag fests.
The central fortress contains a Clone of Hitler which scores -1 team points and Reduces Armo and ammo of the enemy
team. Each team has a stockpile of ammo which the other team can steal, the other team gets 2 team points and a team reload
every time they touch it. Landmines only show up if skill is set to "3". 

POINT SYSTEM:
Clone - "-1" team points to enemy team
Supply - 2 team points
 

======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, and all the guys that shoot me on the company 
network during lunch, without whom I would have no reason to make maps like this. Thanks Tim, Kevin O, Manny, Kevin C.,
Barry, Dave & Brian.
