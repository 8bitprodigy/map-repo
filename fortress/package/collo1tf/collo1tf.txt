*Install*
Copy the Collo1TF.bsp to the Fortress\MAPS (DIR).

*Game play*
This Map is Like Rocket Arena.
Team 1, BLUE Gladiator's, 5 player's, 4 classes, 10 Lives.
Team 2, RED Gladiator's, 5 player's, 4 classes, 10 Lives.
Team 3, Spectator's, Unlimited, Civilian. 
Team 4, VIP's (Me & SK's), 2 player's, Sniper.

)))) Warning this Map NEED's PLayers to behave or I wont work well ((((((( 

} Gladiator's {
The Glads start in a box looking over the arena with a telleporter between
them.
Ingame the player can choose how many shall fight 1 on 1 is best, just jump
in the telle 1 at a time( NO SHOOTING in CHAPEL ), Then go in YOUR teams Door
there are Colured arrows.

In the Tunnel there's a Resupply Bag, It Give's a FULL load in 1 HIT &
Your Teams Flag(Dont mess around in this part of the map), It takes 10 seconds
to recharge, so team member must wait if more than 1 on 1.
Im NOT SURE what will happen with more, it might work fine.
)))))))))))))))))))))))) IMPORTANT ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
Dont MESS with the map Between the BAG, LIFTS & out arena door,
There are Trigger's for the Spot lights, Incomming Message's &
a Button YOU must press to open the DOOR's.
))))))))))))))))))))))))))))END(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
 
In the Arena, You Fight till 1 dies & drops his FLAG, Take his
Flag to Your TF WAR STANDARD at END of arena.
That will give you Point's and a Recharge for the next enermy player(s).
Its Winner stays ON.
You only have 10 live's.
DONT LEAVE THE SPECTATOR's OUT OF THE FUN :).

} Spectator's {
Do what you like or can.

} VIP'S {
You Can go in the Royal box & shoot anyone missbehaving
Dont Mess about as VIP's or ill make them Civilian.
Dont shoot Player's in Arena unless they shouldnt be there.
Player's in the ARENA can KILL any VIP's doing wrong.
YOUR not a VIP just by chooseing team 4, your see.

*Map Story*
Its a Colloseum, you should know.

*Story Behind the map*
I made a Rocket arena map without reading the RA spec's, It was to
GOOD for RA so I made it into this.
I did Cut lots away and sent it to RA, they never used it.
 
TF entity's are much better then any other QC, I could make as
playerable Map's as QUAKE2 "claim's" to have, I think TF now that to
and the Future could be FUN. 
 

*Wouldcraft*
The best ever EDITOR, The key to editing quake is a line somewhere in the
WC Tutorial's it is something like this
" Treat it like LEGO just stick Block to block "
REMEBER DOOM\DN3D sidedef's,linedef's just to move a wall offten killed the level.  

*Ented*
Well what a tasty little program, I was doing a complex entity level,then
I read TFmap and decided ctf would do and then I found Ented v2.?.
Whitch was easy just point and click, but one day my map went back in time
by about 3 days work almost all the TFent gone(gutted).even with that delay
Ented saved week's.V2.5a took about 5min's to load my level .V2.5b about
5 sec's and there both as stable as it get's or need's to be.
Well what a tasty little program.

*TF Bot's*
They Dont like this map.
