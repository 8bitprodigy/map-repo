Playin`: Run and steal the enemy sheep then return it to your pentagram and *uNF* it.  There are water entrances in the out side water to get into the bases.  When exiting YOUR BASE the one the left is the entrance to the enemy's water passage and the one to the right is the one to you base.  There are resuply bags in on the roof of the ramp room (I love well6!)

Credits:  Thanks to Kyle Graehl (eV.Someone) for making Blue1 (thats where I got the sheep mdl).  Jim Kaufman (Sgt.Thundercok) for making Well6 (thats where i got the roof resup idea from). And to Null from Fifth Element for the map making help at 2 am. :P
