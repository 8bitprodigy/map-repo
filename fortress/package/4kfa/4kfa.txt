* Description *

Ever play sq1 with more than two players?  It's not great for dm'ing because
you lose frags for killing teammates, of course.  I thought it'd be neat to
have a 4-player TF DM'ing arena, so I made Kung Fu Arena, verrrry loosely
based on the arena in The Matrix (I named the map the night I came home from
seeing it the second time heh).

This is my second map, and like Thunderdome (tdome.zip) I've tried to keep 
things fairly simple.  Most 1on1 maps have the doors opening on the arena 
floor, so I thought I'd make it a bit different and have players coming up 
from below ground level.  If you're good, you may be able to take a strategic
advantage using the beams.  Otherwise, it's a fairly straightforward arena.
