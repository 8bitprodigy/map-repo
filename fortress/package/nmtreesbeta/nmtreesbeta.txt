**map info**

No More Trees is the sequel of Twin Trees and More Trees

Design has been totally redone and map partially transformed:
trees have been cutted down and the gondola is gone
subterranean corridors have collapsed
...

Gameplay is almost standard: steal the key in enemies base but bring it to ENEMIES capture point
(on the platform over the lava cistern)
That platform can be lowered by pushing the button on the side of the cistern

That's all, don't forget to send me your comments.
