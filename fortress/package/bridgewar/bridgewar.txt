Description             : The idea for this map came out of an earlier
                          map I made that I never released called King
                          of the Hill (there are probably many of maps
                          like it I never saw but who cares?)  The
                          object is to get a player from your team
                          on the platform at the center of the bridge
                          and keep him there.  Every 15 seconds,
                          the team holding the bridge will be resupplied.
                          There is little health on this map, making medics
                          necessary.  A lighter part of the bridge can be
                          destroyed by a detpack to make it much harder for a
                          team to get to the center.  And be sure to
                          look for the special armor hidden on the map.
                          And if you get confused by this description, you aren't
                          alone cause I couldn't make much sense of it when
                          I read it either.
