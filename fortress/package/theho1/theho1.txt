 This map is a variation of the ever-so-popular 2fortX series.  There
were some problems I felt I addressed in this "version" of 2fort5.

 Sniper and soldier power has been reduced. A team can snipe outside on
a ledge,  but they will also have to keep in mind of the snipers on the
half-bridges in the middle.  Soldiers are given less power with the tighter
hallways and rocket jumps that can be barely made.

 Scouts are given power as they can jump over the half-bridge gaps, as well
as the water gap.  At the same time, engineers are given more power,
with many dark spots in the map, as well as a flag room that is just begging
for a sentry somewhere.

 Offense is given more power, as this map is very cappable.  There are now
three routes to the flag room floor, and getting the flag out is all
downhill.  Grouping is heavily emphasized with the many spots in the map
that lend to group meeting.  The flag room also has a window that lends to
grenade tossing, making defending in the flag room difficult.  In a respect,
defense is given some power since all offense will be coming in from
below them.  Heavy weapons guys are encouraged in areas such as the
long pipe by the water.

My main objectives in completing this map were as follows:
1)  Strengthen offense so there are more caps.  I primarily wanted to
eliminate the temptation for a clan to go all defense.  Doing so in this map
will not help because of the multiple routes to the flag and base, as well
as grouping areas.
2)  Encourage a variety of classes instead of the typical soldier/sniper
powerhouse teams.
3)  Increase the size of the "2fortx" series so that larger games could be
played.

Philosophy behind this map:

I know some of you may disagree with the layout of the map.  I can maybe
explain to you why it is setup the way it is.

First off, the broken bridge outside is there to prevent the snipers from
having total control over the front area.  The broken bridge is a third
route with little chance for the sniper to hit you (if you're careful).

Yes, if you notice, scouts can hop over the broken bridge as well as the
fault between the two maps.  Sure, scouts have a lot of power in this map,
but is your team willing to risk the frags?  Don't forget the power that
engineers have with all of the shadows and rock ledges...  that should even
things out.  If you're able to figure out otherways across the broken
bridge with other classes, just trust me, there are.  

The long tunnel leading to the water is long because I wanted to encourage
a possible HWGUY defense at that position.   

The water well is there as a third way up to the flag room area.  It is long
and dark because it would otherwise be very easy to jump in there and end
up at the top.  I figured the enemy should have to lose some life if they
use a slow class like a soldier (which I wanted to deter use of anyway).

The hole at the flag room is there to not only tease the enemy, but to also
make flag room defense difficult.  Some may figure out that that is a key
area to coordinate attacks with.  If you toss grenades in while you're team
is arriving, you can have an effective strong hold on their defense.

The reason why the lift only works for the home team is I don't want to make
it too easy for an enemy to pop up the lift and run to the flag.  They have
to grenade jump up or figure another way up (trust me, there are).  Besides,
just think of how easy it is to take the flag out that way (although you
will have to rocket jump or carefully end up on the level ground in the
ramp room).

The reason why I made the "basement" at the top is I wanted to give the
defense SOME help since the offense is already going to have a huge
advantage.

The ramps are hard to make with rocket jumps because I wanted to deter
soldier use.  Soldiers and snipers are over emphasized as is, so I thought
this map would encourage other classes.

The reason why the resupply nearest the broken bridge is so sparse with
ammo is because it should be a respawn "similar to the grates of 2fort5."
I wanted another resupply, and since that resupply is closer than the
other two to the other base, I wanted to trim down the "goodies" in there.
