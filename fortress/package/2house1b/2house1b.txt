  This is a new TF level that has 2 bases (castles). Your
goal is to retrieve the enemy flag, return your base touch
your base with the enemy's (Capturing the Flag).  This is
the my Second TF map.  This map may be too small for a 16
player game, future maps will be larger, I apologize for this.
