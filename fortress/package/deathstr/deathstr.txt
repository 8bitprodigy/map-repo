this has the flags higher up so the offence has to work a little harder to get them, suggested by sandz

map info:
put the bsp in fortress\maps

Its basically a rip off of well6 and h4rdcore since i cant come up with any good ideas myself.

The maps pretty self explanatory, cept the teleporter could confuse some ppl. The bars open when someone pushes one of those buttons, so if you use the enemy teleporter you cant get out unless someone on the outside (or in the resupply room) presses one of the buttons (oh no, coordination on attack, run away screaming h4rdcore fans).

You cap behind your own tower.
Make sure the map is played with rj 1 (if anyone can rj up to the catwalk with one rocket on rj1 let me know)
No copyright notices, edit whatever you want, but please dont make the flag droppable (flag dropping + high flag area = gay)

yeah, let me know what you think.

thanks to:
twisted, el-jimzo, mercury, lordy and sandz

some random numbers:
flag return is 40 seconds
bars stay open for 15 seconds
