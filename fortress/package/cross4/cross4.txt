Description : Small, cool, and improved map

============================ Changes ============================

from border1 to Cross2

Sounds: Some guy saying when is your honor son  & stuff when a 
        Border Patrol Officer trys to cheat and get onto Mex grounds.
	
	A new start up sound for transport vehicle.

	bugs says hit the road when, well, the immigrants hit the road.

	Buthead says that was cool when immigrants get the quad.

Textures: the road has a different texture, and a few other minor 
things.

Structures: More hills. 

            The "van" is now a "ship"

Misc: Blue cannot (without noclip or god mode) get on Mex grounds.
      
      Red cannot go over the wall, they can however still jump off
      the truck onto the ground (with skill). 

      There is a panel on the "ship" with activates the ship.

      There is a rear exit in the sniper tower, so u don't get picked
      off when u spawn there.
      
      AMMO PACKS! for MiB and Border Patrol.

      Immigrants now have quad for 60 seconds, need to go in back 
      corner of the immigrant building, 1st or 2nd level 
      (maybe changed if I hear of to many assholes killing Mib agents,
      so don't do it or you will be helpless again.

from Cross2 to Cross2r      

New mdls. Fixed the hitroad sound. New sounds. other different stuff.
Fixed know bugs. see below for more.

from Cross2r to Cross3

so many changes i skipped it :)

from Cross3 to Cross4

Started over due to a CIH virus which deleted al my .map files
alot of different things, just check it out, still have in packs, which 
I was the first person to do this. The ship/van is now a military like 
transport with no roof, but it has a huge lower area so you can avoid
being shot by the border patrol better. I added a plat going up to the
yellow spawn building so MIB could go up there and snipe, and not 
have to spawn there, and mexicans can also go up (in case yellow decides
to sit there and sniper of rocket etc mexicans. MIB can not go into
the mexican building or on top of it (to elminate demomen and soldiers
going in and killing mexicans left and right. And best of all the Border
Patrol can't cross the border anymore.

======================= Game Play ======================== 



This is a TeamFortress map.



There are 3 teams,

        1. Border patrol - they kill everyone

        2. Mexicans - Try to make it across the border to the end
           (kill Border Patrol ONLY)

        3. Protectors of the innocent Mexicans - they help the
 	   Mexicans get to America. (kill border patrol ONLY)

Packs,

        Red's backpack is on the Mexican building, it heals them.

        Yellow's backpack is on thier building, it refills and
        heals them.

        Blue's backpack is in the small building next to the border,
        it refills and heals them.


POINT SYSTEM:



        Every immigrant that makes it to america gets 5 personal frags.



IN The Future:
	
	If yellow continues to kill the mexicans I will put the apoc 
        things back into effect for the mexicans or will allow them
        to have a shotgun, so follow the rules, or it will be payback
        time. Also I know a cheat to be a normal class as a mexican.
        So again, WATCH IT!
