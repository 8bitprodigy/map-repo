Description             : This map is made for Team Fortress version 2.5 and
                          can't be used for normal play. This map is a new
                          version of the crapy F4F.map that I made ages ago
                          and it contains some of its unique qualities
                          E.g. Water tower and Z bridge.
                          This is only beta version an is not finished, it is
                          a demonstration of the "aqutecture" that will be in
                          the finished product.
