**** This map designed for the TeamFortress v2.7 quakeC mod **** 
 
**** People who will run this on a server need to read tfservfa.txt

**** .wav files go in Fortress\sound  directory

**** This is probably Quake World only. But you can try it in Normal quake TF. 
  
**** You can contact me if you want to build an arena. But you should
     only do so if you own a server or have a clan server you can access and
     find ppl like playing this TF mod.

You can use all classes now.
Mortal Kombat sounds are in! 
No dets - cause you could kill someone you're not fighting.
No Sentries - unless you pick up a pack with cells.
Medics can't disease ppl and you shouldn't hit someone your fighting or it will 
heal them up to 100 health ;). 
Grenades are different for each class (thanks to Network for some tips)
