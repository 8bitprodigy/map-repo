New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No, but I borrowed medpack.mdl from somewhere(can't remember where).
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : None, who would replace that great TF movie?


* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft and  TF EntEd
Known Bugs              : Dispensers tend to fall through the floors on the ramps to flag. I'm 			          not too concerned about fixing this though. I'd rather engineers use 
                          dispensers to reload the team. It is TEAM Fortress, right? The bug 
			  where the mdls could not be downloaded is fixed now. Thanks to John 
			  Cook.

Build Time              : Too long. Two weeks on and off due to school. Then two more weeks to 
			  fix bugs and improve the map.
Compile machine         : Pentium 200, 32 Megs
Compilation Time        : Around 15 mins total (using rvis)

================================================================

* The Aim *
	
	Standard Capture the Flag TF. Actually, it's a computer chip, and you have to process it,
but you get the idea. Silicon Valley, as in the place where you computer chips are made. Figure 
it out. Also intended to make TEAMS necessary...I hope it works...

================================================================

* Latest Version *
	
	This map is the same as the GTF map; I have changed the name with for this latest version 
due to suggestions from a couple people. They wanted the file name to resemble the map title.
In addition to fixing the mdl bug, I added more armor and ammo.

* Other Info *
	
	This map is the same as the GTF map; I have changed the name with for this latest version 
because of suggestions from a couple people. They wanted the file name to resemble the map title.
	Well, this map is pretty simple. Two forts at opposite ends of the map separated by water (hmmm...sounds familiar). In addition to a narrow bridge, there are two ledges high on the walls providing a way across the water. Of course, there are water passages to get you out of the water if you fall in.
	This map is intended to be hard to cap on. The chip return is set at 25 seconds to make 
it more difficult for one person to cap alone by moving the flag forward bit by bit. Hopefully 
this map will force people to work in organized team fashion, such as assault and defensive 
squads.
	When you steal the enemy's chip, take it to the computer terminal at the entrance to the
flag area.  Capping the enemy chip does NOT add to individual frags. I did this to allow 
players(mostly clans) who think individual frags are all that matters(it's not) a chance to see 
who really does the best. Team scores are the standard 10 points per cap.
	There is a door immediately to the left inside each base that can only be opened
by the home team; it's not a bug. Also, the respawn doors are one way to prevent respawn camping
(thanks to John Cook, 2fort5, for the idea). Due to the small bases and people complaining about 
respawning making it too difficult to cap, I'll see if I can change it for the next version
(assuming I have to do another). 
	Everything else you should find out in play.  :)
