Description:     This is my first ever map that i have worked on so don't
                 blame me if it is like some maps you have played before
                 You get the flag from the enemy base and take it to your
                 base and you cap it for the points with a twist of gianing
		 health for your team also some other stuff ;) but if they 
                 get hold of your flag you will lose some health so dont let
                 them get it.....

===================Gameplay=============================================

This is a map for the Rather Grand QuakeC Teamfortress patch,
You have two teams, a Red team and a Blue Team
The idea is for a team to gain access into the enemys base, steal the flag
and escape, while stopping the other team doing the same from your base.
