EMAIL:		(could change quite a lot, use ICQ)	anita.newman@virgin.net

AUTHOR:		Eciton (A. Newman)

NAME:		2cylin4 (what a name, so original, so inspired ;) )

THE MAP:	This is my first attempt at a teamfortress map.
		I created it to be very small, for three reasons:
			1. There are plenty of big maps
			2. Servers often don't have more than 10 people on
			3. Small maps run faster.
		It sort of evolved from the idea of a wall in the middle, 
		which is accessible to both teams.
		I added the bases, and they evolved from there.
		There is no water, as I find it becomes too easy to die in it if you are 
		lagged.
		This is a player's map: it is shoddy, but designed for easy playing- 
		no lifts to get trapped in by lag, no water to drown in, and no doors to 
		get stuck shut by your lag.
		Also, there are no respawn rooms, so this discourages somewhat respawn 
		camping, and makes the game a lot faster. I used fast respawning packs to 
		give ammo and health, as I found that waiting for ammo/health/armour was 
		really annoying. There are two of these per team.
		There are no special features on the map: just get the flag :)

EDITOR:		I made it on worldcraft 1.1a, which is brilliant, and QuArK for some 
		entity modification.
		It took about 3 weeks of sporadic work, so about 5/6 hours or so.
		I used rvis, qbsp256c and light.

MAP DATA:	The data for this is here, although it  was done in a dosbox so some data 
		is lost:
	qbsp:		entdata	12813
			31 	textures
			127	seconds
	light:		112 	entities
			535 	seconds
			216712	lightdatasize
	vis:		916	seconds
			30797	compressed visdata size

	TOTAL TIME:	1578	seconds

KNOWN BUGS:	1. In steep tunnels, grenades drop through floor
		2. Top red stairs are red
		3. Little gaps here and there
		4. Can drop past air tunnel (I did this deliberately, just tellin' ya :) )
		5. Misaligned textures
		6. Hundreds of 'brightness' fields which I couldn't be bothered to remove 
		appear on startup. Guaranteed removal if you like this version :)
		7. Says sf's home on startup, though it might not be <:0
		8. When I test it I always appear in the same place: feedback on multiplayer
		necessary.

MACHINE: 	This was done on a Gateway 2000 P200 MMX with 32MB RAM, 10.2GB HDD, 
		3dfx, 4MB video card.

ME:		I'm Anthony Newman, from Windsor, UK, and on servers as Eciton (Latin for 
		Ant [real name] :)  )


THANKS:		Thanks to the teamfortress team, ID software, and the makers of worldcraft 
		and quark.
		Also, thanks to the makers of other maps (chaos1 +2fort5) for giving me 
		examples of tf_goals and packs.

Enjoy! and give me feedback on ICQ: 6131368

PS: sorry this text file is a bit disorganised :), but I couldn't be bothered to plan it etc.
