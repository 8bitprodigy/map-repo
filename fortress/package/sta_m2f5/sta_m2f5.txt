* Game Play *

If you know 2fort4-5 then you know how to play this map.
A couple of new things added:
1) The enemy flag located in the basement has two entrances to the flag 
   room; Both are hallways accessable from the basement.
2) Under the bridge is the water access to the fort.  The water entrance
   leads to a spiral staircase that comes out inside the fort's lower level

This map follows STA Mega Division Default Settings
Tie-Breakers also follow the same setting

Umm....Enjoy the Map!!
