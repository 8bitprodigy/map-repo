This is an attack/defend map designed to be played by 2 teams. 

Team 1 has to defend the castle from attack for 10 minutes. There is a large
button near the gateway which opens the main gates.

Team 2 has to storm the castle, and break through the inner door. There are
buttons on either side of the castle which open the main gates. Once inside,
there are 6 more buttons which have to be pressed to open the inner gates.
Team 2 wins once they get a player beyond the inner gates.

There is a small resupply room inside the castle.
