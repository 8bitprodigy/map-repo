* Description *

How many 1on1 maps are there anyway? 20? 30?  I figure, why not make another
one :-)  It's intended for soldier 1on1's, though there's probably just enough
variety for any class to play.

This is my first map, so I've tried to keep things fairly simple.  Ramps,
ammo, a couple of doors and full backpacks (minus gren2's).  I thought I'd add
some platforms, in case you take some serious gren damage, go flying, and need
an advantage.  On the other hand, it's not such a huge advantage in that you
will probably take some rocket splash damage from the walls behind you, or
hurt yourself jumping or falling down.  Also, there aren't alot of shadows,
but there are some that players may find useful.

Hope that's everything needed for this text file.  Enjoy.
