Objectives
----------

Demoman clears barricade
0 points
Demoman
Repairable
	
Demomen from opposing teams can clear/repair the barricaded entryways located near each base's 
sniper bunkers. Note that you can blow up your own barricade AS WELL AS the enemy's barricade. 
Use this to your advantage. Also - you can repair your own barricade as well as the enemy's barricade - but why bother?

	---

Engineer hacks doors 
2 points 
Engineer
Not repairable

Engineers from either team can 'hack' the doors of the enemy team's outer resupply room to open 
up an alternate route into the enemy base's upper floor. To do this, simply shoot away at the 
console located near these doors until the console lights go out. Note that you cannot repair these doors once they have been 'hacked', so guard them closely!

	---
	
Deactivate coolant system 
2 points, opens pressure door 1
Any class
Repairable

Deactivate generator A 
2 points, opens pressure door 2	
Any class
Repairable

Deactivate generator B 
2 points, opens chip room door	
Any class
Repairable

To deactivate a component, simply shoot at it until something happens. Grenades (except the nail grenade) will not damage the component. Recommended weapons of war include the assault cannon and super nailgun. Once a component is deactivated, something will happen - lights will go out, doors will be opened...

You can't deactivate your own components, and you can't repair your enemy's components. Duh!

Each team's chip room will only become accessible when their generator B has been deactivated. 
If their generator B is repaired, their chip room will become inaccessible again. 

As you can guess, the chip room is the most important aspect of your base.

	---
	
Cap the chip
10 points
Any class	

Repair coolant system
5 points, closes pressure door 1
Any class

Repair generator A 
5 points, closes pressure door 2
Any class

Repair generator B 
5 points, closes chip room door
Any class

Once the enemy chip room is accessible, take their chip back to your base and 'sell it to the 
highest bidder' by 'capping' it at the pad on the upper floor, or use the chip to repair any 
one of your components.

To repair a component, simply take the chip from your enemy's chip room back to the component you
want to fix. Repairing components will reverse the result of deactivating it - i.e. repairing the 
coolant system closes off pressure door 1, repairing generator A closes off pressure door 2.

Note that repairing your coolant system, generator A, and generator B will award your team 5 points as well as closing off the respective pressure doors.

----------
Other info
----------

INDICATORS - There are 'indicators' of your generator/coolant status in your base. You'll find 
these in two locations - on the ground floor to the right of the ground-level entrance, and on 
the first floor near the window overlooking the yard. If the light is on, that component is 
functional. If the light is out, that component needs to be repaired.

PRESSURE DOORS - These provide an alternate route into the enemy's generator B/chip room and the
lower floor of each base, and are opened by deactivating the associated objectives.

HACKABLE DOORS - These provide an alternate route into the upper floor of each base via the 
enemy team's outer respawn. You CANNOT resupply in the enemy's respawn room.

SLIME ROUTE 'O' DOOM - This is the underground passageway linking the two bases. Use it at will,
but be careful not to fall into the slime!

SNIPER BUNKERS - There are four of these located in the big grassy areas between the bases. Boom!

THE CHIP - If you are killed while carrying the chip, it will drop to the ground for another person to pick up, and remain there for 15 seconds, after which it returns to the corresponding chip room.

GREN2/DETPACK - Gren2s and detpacks are available from each team's outer respawn room with a delay of 5 seconds.

SECRET AREAS - Be careful with that axe, Eugene...

Tactics
-------

- n/a -

The map is designed in such a way that priorities of teams can vary between 'capping' the chip 
and keeping their components working.

Happy fragging!
