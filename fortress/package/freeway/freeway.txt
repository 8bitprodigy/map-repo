* How to Play *

Team 1 (Police): (MAX 3 PLAYERS)
  Keep the crack addicts from getting the suitcase full of money! :)
  If they do, by all means, make sure they don't take it back to their
  little locker (on the lower road). If they do, they will get 10 points,
  the Hired Goons will get 5 points, and the addicts will get quad.

Team 2 (Governmental Agents): (UNLIMITED PLAYERS)
  Grab the suitcase full of money (on the upper deck), and take it back
  to your locker on the lower deck. Easier said than done. To get there, you
  will have to traverse lots of terrain - well, not a whole lot, but a fair
  bit. You can use the elevator or go in back into the shipping entrance.

Team 3 (Hired Goons): (MAX 3 PLAYERS)
  Your job is simple. Keep the Crack Addicts from being killed at all costs.
  Help them get the suitcase to the locker. Take bullets for them. Etc.
