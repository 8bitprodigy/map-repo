* Other Info *

This is a map designed for 2 teams. Team One defends the fort in the
center of the map. Team Two has to penetrate the fort's defences. The
map ends when a member of Team Two gets right to the back of the fort.

This map was originally an (unreleased) deathmatch level, designed by
Jason, be he decided it would be good for TeamFortress. So I just added in
some teamplay goals.


How to use this map:
Copy the seige.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map seige" (without the quotes)
