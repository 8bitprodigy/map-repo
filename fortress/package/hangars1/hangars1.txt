* Files included in this archive *
hangars.bsp            : Map file. (see below for instructions)
hangars.txt            : The text file you are reading now :)

* Game play *
This is a standard 2 team, 2 flag TeamFortress CTF level.
Each team must defend their flag and attack the enemy team and steal their
flag. Once the enemy's flag has been captured and put in the back of the truck
the whole team should get 10 frags.

* Things you need to know about this map *
Nothing really special about this map except for the design I hope.  The only 
detail you need is that only a demoman can blow the grate to enter the teleporter
at the bottom of the drain.

* Map History *
Well, none exceptional except that I got the idea while walking around a work, 
made a few basic schetches and set to work figuring out how to make Worldcraft work,
that done it took me about 3 weeks to get the design made and a further 3 weeks to make
the entities and textures right.

* My Other Maps *
No other maps made yet but plenty in the designing(head) stage.  I made a domed roof
a few days ago and intend to make an Abbey/Cathedral map soon for the Brotherhood Clan.
