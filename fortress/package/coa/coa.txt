Installation:
The sound files goes into quake/fortress/sound/misc
The map file goes inte quake/fortress/maps/
This file into where you use to store these txt files ;)

Details:

 Capture the grail (flag) and take it back to your tower.

General:
 Their are no doors that stop anyone... everyone can go everywere. So if you hate
 Respawn campers, protect your respawn... that is easy. Lots of walls and a shelf to stand on
 :) You have to think a bit on how to get everywhere though it's not easy to find your
 way through this map. Even I get confused.

Class specific:

Scout - a good level jump and you'll get by many. :)

Sniper - Well, the though of this level was to make it good for snipers... but still hard.
	There are many dark corners that are perfect for sniping but it will be easy
	to kill you there. The snipernest is built so you can't shoot at the other 
	snipernest.. (or at least you should not be able to, but it can be done)
	the purpose of this is that you as a sniper should help yout teammates who
	are trying to force their way up the ramps. Without a sniper in the snipernest,
	it will be hard to take the flag, very hard !!! I call this offdeff sniping :)

Soldier - Hummm... I never play soldier so I diden't give them much thought in this map,
	but as i noticed they can pose a threat to the snipernest. Shooting rockets from
	the ramps into snipernest.

Demoman - Well a camping demoman at top of the ramps might be a match for everyone,
	this is what the snipers have to remove... :)

Medic - Well a medic for flag protection is ideal... the flag is a long way from the supply
	and your teammates won't have the time to get it, and they will get hurt. 
	Help them !!!

Hwguy - Well... same as soldier I guess.

Pyro - Put the ramp campers on fire... they are a long way from their supply !!!

Spy - The usual, infiltrate their respawn... occupy their elevators and so on.

Engineer - Their are lots of dark corners and shelfs and walls to build sentrys behind.
	Your dispenser will really be needed in the upper part of the tower (around the flag).
	But it will be hard to build a sentry up there... a long way to the supply :)
	

Have fun !!!
