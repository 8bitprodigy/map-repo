======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag" map.

There are two teams to play on, each with their own flags. Once you have the flag, return it to your capture point which is at the top of the lift in your Library/Respawn room.

Section 6
======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Initially designed to satisfy demands from the UKTF community for a smaller map for use with smaller teams, it seems to have grown a little. It should still play fairly well with small teams.

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress and id software for Quake

There are a few new textures in this map which I spent quite a bit of time creating, I have no objection to other map makers using these textures in their own creations, but a word of recognition wouldn't go amiss!

Special thanks go once a again to SLAG PUPPY and his brother RICK for play testing, suggestions and comments

Finaly a beeeeg thankyou to the TF console at clan Erinyes and clan Oski, Its a mega site, I think I spent half the contruction time for this map browsing their site.

I have made extensive use of the textures used by Rogue software. If anyone has a problem with this please let me know and I will remove the map from my site and put out a message to all ftp sites holding this map.
