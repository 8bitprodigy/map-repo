Bugs:                   : Some grey outs when you're on top of the turrets
                          at the back of a castle, and are looking to
                          other castle.  You can fix this locally, by
                          setting r_maxsurfs to 1200, and setting
                          r_maxedges to 2800.  Just put the following two
                          lines in your .cfg file.

                                r_maxsurfs 1200
                                r_maxedges 2800

Changes since version 4 : We now don't allow the demoman

                          A Spawn point pointed the wrong way, and a
                          couple of red spawns said 'Get them reds'...

                          Slight speed increase made by splitting the map
                          sections a little more effectively.

                          The enemy key dropoff point now requires that
                          your team's key is in it's initial resting
                          place.

                          Added heat restistance to the Blast armor.

Changes since version 5:  Got rid of the annoying sticky out bits that
                          annoyed the hell out of everyone.

                          Straightened out a few minor brushes.
