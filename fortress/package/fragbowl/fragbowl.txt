======================= Game Play ======================== 

There are 2 teams to this map, Blue and Red. It's a simple scenario - Blue and Red fight each other to capture the enemy Key. Blue and Red's bases are identical except for the textures. For a Normal Key Capture take the enemy key from their basement and return it to the Dragon Mosaic in your attic. A player carrying the enemy key can also pass through the Quad Arch in the middle, which will give his\her team 30 secs of Quad damage if the player then makes it to the Dragon Mosaic with the Key.

	10 Frags for Key Score only.
	20 Frags for Key Score through Quad Arch.
        3 Count for picking up Key.
        10 Count for Key Score only.
        20 Count for Key Score through Quad Arch.
        (I think.)

As the map is quite small, I had originally intended to restrict the classes, but the testers said, "leave 'em in," so I left them in - good luck if you don't have much armor...
