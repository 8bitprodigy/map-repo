* Other Info *

    This is a map designed for 4-16 players, in two teams. The objective
is to capture as many flags as possible from the enemy base, and prevent
the enemy from capturing your own flags.

   There are three flags, one is down a long corridor (the CORRIDOR flag)
which is worth one point. There is the one above the lava (the LAVA flag)
which is worth three points, and there is one down some steps (the
STEPDOWN flag) which is worth one point. 

   There is a resupply point in each base, which takes 10 seconds to
'recharge' after it is used, before it can be used again.

   If you run it without the TeamFortress mod, you will get about 12 pages
of errors when you run the map, but you will still be able to look
around.


How to use this map:
Copy the fastflag.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map fastflag" (without the quotes)
