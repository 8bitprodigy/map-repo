* Map info *

After downloading all the TF-maps at ftp.cdrom.com, I found out that there were only a few maps
that weren't Capture the Flag maps. Since i thinks these levels are very dull, I decided to make
my own level. The result became a three team Team Fortress level.
The plot goes like this:
Two teams, you might say the good and the bad, are on a quest to get to heaven and hell. But in 
their way is the third team. They are the guardians of the roads to heaven and hell and are not 
allowed to let anyone through. 
Team one must reach hell, team two heaven and team three must stall them both for 35 min.
