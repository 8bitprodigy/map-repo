This is a standard 2 castle (slott in swedish),
capture the flag map.
The door and the well leading to the flag opens
with a grenade thrown into the hole on level 2.
The flash grenade doesn't seem to damage the button
though, so scout isn't able to open the door ;-)
When you've taken the flag you shall return it
to the top of your castle on a little platform.
Watch out, there might be a chance to get sniped!

How to use this map:
Copy the slottar1.bsp file into your quake/tf25/maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map slottar1" (without the quotes)

When hanging in the corner of the level, surfs
exceeds 800 and some walls goes gray, this
problem you can fix by increase the surfs variable
to 900 (You have to reload the map for the changes
to take place).
ex:
	r_maxsurfs 900
	map slottar1

		Happy fraging. and remember, eat barkis!
