* Objective *

The objective is fairly simple, you run to the enemy base, get down to the 
lower levels (by using the underwater teleporter) and steal their flag.  
Then you run back over to your base and down to the lower levels and bring
it back to where your flag was.  Your flag doesn't have to be there, you 
just have to bring the flag to the general area around where your flag was,
simple huh?

I also added another aspect to this map, I made a storeroom on the first 
lower level.  In this storeroom are boxes, and a demoman has to set a detpack
to blow the boxes up and the team scores 5 points.  But the trick is, the 
demoman can't open the door himself, but any other player can and has to
open the door for the demoman.  I added this to promote teamplay, now a team 
of people have to rush the base and survive to allow the demoman to set the
pack and get out of the room to get the five points.

One last thing added to this map is that each team has two special rooms. One
of these rooms is marked by a cross, and this is the medics room.  In this 
room he can heal the entire team.  The other room is marked by a hammer, and
this is the engineers room.  In this room he can give armor to the entire 
team.  Both healing and protecting can be used once every 45 seconds.


* Other Info *

After making the first DeadZone, I took a break from making TF levels and 
joined on with the QW32 level project and that took a big chunk of my time.
Then I almost completed a level for a TC, but dropped that.  I didn't make 
another level for a month or so, and after seeing the popularity of the
first DeadZone (which is #2 in the Top Ten at Kraq's when I wrote this txt 
file) I decided it was time to spruce the level up and expand the size.  As
you can see, this level has around 3 times as many brushes, which means it's
more detailed, but still not lagged.  
                          
* Comments *

This will be my 2nd attempt at a Team Fortress level, and my 3rd level made 
overall.  This will also be the last CTF Style map I'm going to make for 
Team Fortress, because you can do so much more with TF then capture the flag,
and I have some ideas, but that's all I'll say for know.  Also, if anyone 
finds any bugs, please report them to me and I'll see what I can do.
