Thanks to               : Id, The Team Fortress guys for writing such an
                          excellent quakeC addon for Quake, Wonko for letting 
                          beta test this level on his server, Storm Shadow, 
                          and of course all of my beta testers
* Map Details *
This level is based off a new concept. There are 3 teams. There is the blue team 
which trys to protect there base from the reds trying to get the flag. The yellow
team which protects the red while getting the flag. And the red team which
are civilians that are the only ones that can get the flag. The reds have to 
take the flag and bring back to the church to give them 10 frags. I also elimanated
the yellow from being engineers so they wont do cheap stuff and kill the civilians.
Another thing that you might want to note is the blues can only have 5 people on
their team, but they get a backpack which gives them a lot of stuff. Oh well.. have fun!
