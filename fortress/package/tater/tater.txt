  This is the first map of its kind as far as i know. 
The objective is very similar to the normal CTF we all know.
There is only 1 flag in the center of the map, whichever team is carrying 
flag will receive 3 teampoints and frags every 30 seconds. Their is NO capping, 
you must simply hold on to it and try to stay alive.
Both teams go after the same flag and therefore whichever team posses the 
flag needs to protect their flagcarrier while the other team must kill him
and steal the flag for their own side.

I hope you all have a good time with it, cause thats what its all about
