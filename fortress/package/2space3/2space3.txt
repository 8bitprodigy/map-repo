--= Gameplay Notes =---------------------------------------------------------

This is a small map, probly best for 5v5 to 8v8. There are 2 new sounds that
I created. The resupply areas we're kept very simple, mainly because I
noticed that most game servers make there own set of entities, so there is
just a generic resupply pack that supplies arrmor, weapons and health all in
one. There is also a neat feature that can only be activated by a Demoman's
detpack, which is offset by a penalty to keep most wankers from abusing it.
