This is a TeamFortress map.

There are two teams to this map, Blue and Red.  Blue is the OFFENSE team, and red is the DEFENSE team.
This map is used as a clan meet map.  The Offense team has there own meeting room and the Defense team 
has their own meeting room.  This allows them to each talk about strategies for an upcoming match or 
practice (using messagemode2).  In the center of the map there are two practice areas.  This includes
the sniper area, and the soldier area.  These areas are meant for 1 on 1 play only, and the soldier area 
can be used by other classes such as demoman, pyro, etc.  That's basically the entire map.  Textures used
include the tech textures and the teamfortress textures.  They make the map have a professional look as 
well as making it look awesome.  Any other information about this map needed can be gotten by emailing
the author.
