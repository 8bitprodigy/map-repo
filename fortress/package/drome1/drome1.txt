* Game Play *

The Drome is an extremely fast-paced Team Fortress/CTF expierence, the object is to cap
the flag upon your own flag... and teams can return their own flag, just like in classic
CTF... I suggest console sets maxfrags to 150 or time limit to about 10-15 mins for this one
since the rounds will tend to wear some players out... less strategy here as action; a test
of that Quake-specific term "skillz".  There are 2 powerups in the map, they are easy to spot
and damned near impossible to reach, especially in the heat of battle. A soldier may use a 
gren/rocket combo jump, a demoman may use pipes (prolly the easiest way), a sniper may shoot
a teammate if team kills are off... and possibly other ways to reach the powerups.

I wanted to make a map that would be fun for as few as 4 players since when [8] got 
its server back, there were not too many peeps that hung out on it ;)  The Drome gets pretty wild
with 8 or so, and above that it will be sheer mayhem, especially when some bastard manages
to get one of the quad/pents.  Guaranteed for a gib-soaked good time ;)
