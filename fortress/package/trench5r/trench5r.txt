[[[ Note ]]]

The ents have been updated on 10-17-02. As you can tell by the RPG quotes on the
packs, it was done by Arc. The other major fixes are that caps reward 10 points like 
normal instead of 1, and the middle pack giving 1 second of pent/quad is possibly
the best rocket jump ever.

Trench5 Update by FlagBanger (FlagBanger@TFDomain.com)
Added resupply packs.
Fixed respawns: Four respawns were partly in the ground, 
	causing some to be stuck on spawning.
Used EntEd to edit, no alterations to the map.
Basically just a modernization and re-intergration into the TF community.

* The Aim *

Very, very simple. Get the flag ! Return it to your bunker. 

There is a resupply pack in each central fort.

There are 2 ways into the other teams underground bunker and only one exit.

	1. Through the bunker entrance - also the way out.
	2. Quick teleport entry - two of them

Nothing else complicated in this level. Should be plenty of scope for lucky
long range shots though. 

Please watch out for the next level - coming soon to a web page near you 

		ESCAPE FROM COLDITZ - THE TEAM FORTRESS LEVEL
