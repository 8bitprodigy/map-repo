Description           : This is somewhat of a sequel to Village.You'll start
                        out in a damp cave that leads to a crack in the rock
                        surrounding a medieval town.You need to find your way
                        down to the harbour to get the key out of this
                        shadow filled place.Far down in the depths of the
                        ocean you will discover an otherworldly place with
                        an exit portal to another dimension.Your passage 
                        through the town will be obstructed by many strange
                        and dangerous creatures.Some of them you may have
                        seen before,others have been altered by the dank and
                        evil fumes of the seaport's atmosphere.You may be 
                        able to use the nail traps and exploding barrels to
                        your advantage....Enjoy!
