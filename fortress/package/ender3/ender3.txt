Is This a Bug?
--------------------
Q. How come I don't fall?
A. Gravity is set to 0.01.  You should still be able to jump, but you don't really fall.

Q. When I press 1, is usually get the grappling hook instead of the axe.
A. Good.  The grappling hook should be enabled on this map.

Q. When I shoot the four buttons, they don't trigger.
A. They might already be triggered.  If you see any blood when you shoot them, they
	aren't triggered yet.  Don't worry, you just have to inflict 100 damage to
	trigger them.

Q. The map ends when I go through the alcove.
A. It's supposed to.

Q. When my team scores, the person who made the score gets more frags than the rest.
A. This is supposed to happen.  I wanted to give extra credit for actually scoring.

Q. Sometimes, some of the walls turn gray.
A. Allocate more memory to Quake.

	First of all, no one's actually going to read this, so I'm not sure why I'm
making it.
	This map was created by Jeremy Lennert and based on the zero-G arena in Ender's
Game by Orson Scott Card, my favorite book of all time.  Quake was created by and is the
property of id software.  This map may be distributed free of charge, but may not be
distributed without this .txt file unless being downloaded directly from a Quake or
QW server.
