Release Notes V7	: 2sphinx6 was one of the maps chosen for The Second Fifth Element 
			  Team Fortress Open (TFO2), which was held on 22 Mar 1998. 8 matches 
			  were scheduled on the map, involving historic clans like AOA, CE, DOW,  
			  GP, UVM, and more. Unfortunately, those matches exposed numerous ent 
			  problems with 2sphinx6 that made it generally unplayable, and the map 
			  was forgotten. Now, 26 years later, I've resurrected it with fixed ents.

Versions 1-6 Author	: Horus/Baby Spice
Base                    : From scratch                              
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft and EntEd
Known Bugs              : There's a slight grey-out when you jump off the ramps right at the
			  back of the top level. You can solve this by doing that r_maxsurfs
			  thing...er or something. Don't look at me! :)
Build Time              : DAYS! Nay, weeks even. Had to learn Worldcraft for a start.
			  This is my first map etc.
                          The full compile time was about 2 hours on a P90 with 32 megs ram
Thanks to               : The guys who wrote the Teamfort thing. Cool.
                          
			  Dr.Debug.MA (AKA Posh Spice) for total and unfailing
			  technical support while I was still learning. Without him 
		          this map would still be nothing but leaks and duplicate planes.                     
			 
			  Jord, for some good constructive criticism gameplay-wise. This is
			  my first map after all, so I won't learn anything unless you tell
			  me people!! :) Check out his cool website: http:\\jord.sbc.edu
 			  
			  Ben Morris for Worldcraft. Had me tearing my hair out at times,
			  but I'm sure that was just me!
				
			  Raistlan for Ented. In the end it saved more stress than it
			  caused. I think :) Definitely with the last beta.

			  Ritalin Boy [Clandestine] for some help with entities for version
			  six and for suggesting the Ankh models, and the Caulfields or 
			  whoever they are for inspiring him :) Also for letting me test
			  version 6 on his server, run by Zephyre.

                          Clan Spice Girls! And the Spice Girls themselves, 'course.
                          ('specially Emma :)

			  id software for er, that thing, erm. I forget.
Release Notes V6	: 26th May 97: Beginning to think I'm jinxed. Apparently the extra 
			  stuff was too much too close together. At any rate there were vis 
			  errors and the flag sometimes just vanished altogether, never to return. 
			  I've taken out one of the extra corridors at each end. Hopefully it now 
			  works. All of it. Perfectly. I've also done some extra models for the 
			  Ankhs, which look pretty good I reckon, but then I would :) Also upped 
			  the recharge packs to give maximum, which is more convenient.
Release Notes V5	: 15th May 97: Version 5 already! People didn't like getting stuck behind 
			  the sarcophagus lid, so I've moved it. Also the flag room was turning out 
			  to be something of a death trap, so added a couple more entrances and exits, 
			  and changed the lava in there to water. The flag is now droppable. It'll 
			  hang around for about 30 secs after death of carrier. There is also more 
			  sniper potential on the top level with a balcony in front of the sphinx. 
			  I also built in a huge statue of Anubis but the map was getting too greedy 
			  in terms of memory for it to stay. Maybe in a later map... Erm, I think 
			  that's it. Oh, in case anyone gets the impression from this version that 
			  I like dropping people from great heights, it's not true :) 
Release Notes V4	: 12th May 97: DOH! That dang respawn somehow crept back into the wall. 
		 	  Definitely fixed now. Cuh, computers, eh?
Release Notes V3	: 9th May 97: Version 3. Widened corridors downstairs: they could get blocked 
			  too easily by sentry guns etc. Score increase for flag capture wasn't 
			  working. Extra backpack behind Sphinx. More team-colours around. Thanks to 
			  Jord for some constructive criticism.
Release Notes V2	: 8th May 97: Kinda OD'ed on quake recently, so only got round to doing this 
			  version a bit later than planned. Moved a respawn in the wall, re-aligned 
			  some textures, got rid of one crater and one tank, put in an extra step 
			  somewhere, er, that's it I think. Oh, also removed a fullbright colour from 
			  the Pharaoh texture, and the Team 2 backpacks now work for Team 2 (Doh!).
Release Notes V1	: 25th April 97: First test map released...
================================================================
* General Guide (V1-6, mostly removed in V7) *

Ok basically it's simple. You gotta get the other guys' flag and shoot them a lot. In order
to capture the other flag <"The Ankh of Isis, or of Osiris"> you have to take it back
to your own flag, WHICH MUST BE THERE: you gotta "reunite" them, see? Successful capture 
nets the whole team 10 frags, 45 secs of Quad and Invis, and also maxes out health, ammo and
armour.

There is a team Quad damage in the crater in the middle: it gives the whole of your team
Quad damage for 30 secs. Likewise, there is a Team Shadowring.

There's also some magic jumpy-off things on the top level that...well, jump off them and
see. Er thats it I guess. Good fragging, people, and enjoy the map!

* LEGAL STUFF *

Blah blah permission etc.
Waffle waffle distribute this map or sommit.
Don't rip bits out 'n stuff.

Basically, give it to who you like, but include this text file. And don't stick it in any
compilation or anything without asking me. Erm, you know the rest. If you wanna use the 
models in anything, ask me.
