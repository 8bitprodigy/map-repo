======================= Game Play ======================== 

  This map is designed to be a fast paced, action filled TeamFortress map.
On this map there are 2 teams: blue and red.  The object of each team is to
capture the other team's flag as many times as possible.  The flag is captured 
by bringing the other team's flag to the capture room in your base. The layout
of each team's base is identical, expect each base has its' team colour.
