====================== GAMEPLAY ========================

OK - simple one. Get the other team's flag. Use the back way or a frontal
assault. Fluid defence is the name of the game here - there are no class
restrictions so be aware that scouts may be after your flag in a BIG way.

Bridges may be detonated by Demomen. They may be repaired only by Engineers
who must hit the six switches (three to each side of the bridge). Engineers
may also break the bridges by hitting the same switches. You only have 30
seconds before the switches reset and they must all be active if the bridge
is to be changed.

Main base doors must be opened with the buttons above them.

Snipers - hide and kill people, you know the drill :)

Thanks to:
Team fortress guys for the trendiest goal ideas - Nova for asking me to
join - iD for Quake (!) - <N>Flob for the kind use of the Nova TF server.

Bugs:

NOTE!! I dont seem to be able to solve this bug - its due to the way
the bridge entites were designed and the way Quake treats them (if I'm
wrong my appologies to iD). Anyway, the lighting on the bridges fails to
light the players properly. You are still visible to other players - but
it is quite difficult to make out sides or some classes. In any instance
this merely means you need to pay more attention :)
