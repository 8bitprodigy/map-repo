Acclaim's Forsaken for the kewl sounds
ID rules, and so do the fellow Aussies who made TF possible, thanks guys!

========== My 2 bid ==========

This is my very first TF map EVER, and is also the first Quake map that I
have ever actually finished (unless you count the city one that has items
falling out of the level all over the place :P )  So please enjoy, and
remember, it is designed for clan practice, or any other time you just can't
seem to get enough people playing.

Look out for my other map, "HOLY.BSP"
It is a "Holy vs Evil" map and is my 2nd TF map.  I just finished it as I
wrote this TXT, and it uses these sounds, plus a few more from Forsaken.
It is a proper sized map, and I think that the sounds really help to create
the mood of the class that the player is...
I have just started a new map, WARZONE (working title).  It is going to be
as good as I can possibly make it, so PLEASE contact me with your ideas on
making the perfect TF map! (so far my ideas include a power plant, trench
warefare, APC's, Helecopters, Airstrikes (when you cap) and anti-aircraft
missile batteries (disarm these if you want the airstrike to work...)
Hopefully the Quake engine will be good enough to make all this a reality...

Thank you for getting my map, but remember, no-one likes it when you alter
their work without their permission! Please let this map remain as it is,
unless I give you permission
