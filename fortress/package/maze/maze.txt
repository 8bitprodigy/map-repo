* Other Info *

	There are two (2) files in the zip

	- maze.txt (this text file)
	- maze.bsp

Put maze.bsp into your id1/maps dir, I put all my maps here. QW and TF will find
them no problem.

Feel free to use the textures in your own TF maps.

This is my first Quake map, and because all I play on the net is TF I figured
it should be a TF map. Makes sense to me.

The object of this map is to get the enemies flag (key) and return it to your
fort by the sniper windows. The dropoff point is pretty obvious. There are 2 
ways into the key room and 3 ways out. You have to be observant to find the 
3rd way out. Hint look at the walls :-). Oh BTW, the 3rd way is only for the 
owners of the fort, not the attackers. Each capture is 10 frags for you and 
your teammates and 1 team point. Plus the one who captures the flag gets 
extra health/armor. 

Unlike most TF maps my backpacks give out grenades, only they are given out 
one every 15 seconds, so if you want to wait a full minute you will have full 
grenades of both types. Also the backpacks give out one of four different 
types of armor, they inform you of which type you just got.

              Kevlar   - Bullet proof
              Wooden   - Nail proof
              Asbestos - Fire proof
              Blast    - Explosion proof

There is a special building in the middle of the maze, with 2 doors. Each door 
only opens for a specific team. There really isn't anything in the room except 
when you first enter. You get 15 seconds of quad damage and 20 health points. 
Basically you enter the room, get buffed up, then exit the way you came in, and 
proceed on your merry way. Only one person from each team can have the quad at 
any one time. Don't want too many frags at a time now do we?


******************
*** Strategies ***
******************

The secret exit in the key rooms is a great place to put a sentry gun, find it 
and you will see why.

There is plenty of room for sentries in the key areas. Plus the key bridge is 
just wide enough to put a sentry on.

I think that demomen will love the fort's towers. Bounce a few grenades off of
the walls for extra distance.

Of course the grappling hook is disabled in this map. I hate the damn thing.

This map is a good guide to map makers as to the maximum size a map can get.
If you turn on NOCLIP and pass thru the wall, with the handicapped sign on 
it, you will understand. If this map were any longer it would not fit into 
Quake's boundaries.
