* Other Info *

Grab the Enemy King and bring it back to your capture point on the snipers nest in your base!

Tip's: Put a detpack on the grate to blow it open.
I made the Snipers nest larger then the 2fort4 to make sniping more fun and to eliminate some of the sniper wars
that you always get on the 2fort maps.
