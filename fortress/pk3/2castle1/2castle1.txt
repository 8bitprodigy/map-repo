Server Admins:
   If you had trouble with 4castle1, this one should be easier on the system
resources...  

Make sure the .mdl files go in fortress\progs.  Also, all the wave files go in 
fortress/sound/misc.  In case you're wondering, The backpack sound is Homer, 
The Flag Snatch sound is from the original George of the Jungle cartoon show,
and the Capture wave is Brak from 'Space Ghost Coast to Coast'....

* Basic Strategy *

   Two Teams, each defending a flag.  
   As far as the layout goes, there are lots of cool sniper resting places, 
but I did my best to build this map so that each class could find a niche in 
the team play.
