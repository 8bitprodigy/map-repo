GAMEPLAY

Basically the same as usual. But this time there are mines to watch out for. get too close 
and BOOM! In case you do step on a mine the usual procedure is to jump 50 meters in the
air and scatter yourself over a large area, remember it well. You can mark the mines with
in the dark fields with lights by pressing the buttons, the first button (marker) buts a 
limited light around the mines on your side. The flood buttom will completely light the 
field and show a little of the enemy field. The flag is held in a shrine in the bottom of 
the fort. just take it to the battlements on your side and capture it. you'll get your team 
full heal and a 5 second quad. use it well my freinds. 


Soon: 2mfield3: because i'm sure there's something ELSE in there you wont like :)
