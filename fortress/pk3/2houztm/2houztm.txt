* Other Info *

  This is a new TF level that has 2 bases (castles). Half this
map (red or blue) is copying the realy UZTM headquarter, 
were I'm worked, this very funny!
Your goal is to retrieve the enemy flag, return your base touch
your base with the enemy's (Capturing the Flag). This map may be
too small for a 32 player game, future maps will be larger,
I apologize for this.
