* Play Information *

This map does not work properly without the TeamFortress v2.1 or
higher QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from
http://www.telefragged.com/teamfortress
or from ftp.cdrom.com (I assume)

Single Player           : Boring
Cooperative             : No
Deathmatch              : No Deathmatch starting points yet.
TeamFortress            : Very much so.  8 starting points
                          per team.
Difficulty Settings     : No
New Sounds              : No

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : WorldCraft v1.0a, EntEd
Known Bugs              : If you get killed by the big flame
                          in the center of the maze you don't
                          seem to be able to respawn...
                          This looks like a TF bug, and should
                          be fixed soon
Build Time              : Too long for design
          (-extra) Light: ~30 minutes
          (-level 4) Vis: ~90 minutes

* Other Info *

This is my first full level for Quake, and since I've been
playing a lot of TeamFortress recently, it seemed only natural
to make another map for it.  I'd love to hear what you think
of it, as I won't learn without any feedback.

I'd also like feedback on the speed of the level.  I have a
Cyrix P150+ w/ 32M, and don't really have access to a slower
Pentium, so I have no idea of what performance would be like
on such.  I have simplified the level a bit as it is, but
let me know if it's too much.

Now about the level itself.  It's a night level with a lot
of open flame. :)  The main feature is a hedge maze between
the two fortresses.  The flags are in the basements, which
are reached via a descending platform on one side of the
room on the second floor.  You then return on a rising
platform that takes you up to the other side of the second
floor room.  Return it to the pool that's at the very back
of your roof.  If you can't find the pool, it glows. :)

I've run vis at level 4 on the map, but in a couple of
places on the back of the roofs, there is still some grey
that appears occasionally.

The following is from 2fort23.txt (a big inspiration for
this level; thanx to John Cook), and it applies here, too.

  "This is a two team capture-the-flag map. Each team
   has their own base, at opposite ends of the map.

   The objective is to infiltrate the enemy base, and
   capture the enemy flag which is in their basement.
   The flag must then be returned to the [pool on the
   roof] of their home fort.

   There are [two] resupply points on the second level
   of each fort.

   The frag count of each player should be their team
   scores.

   How to use this map:
     Copy the hedge6.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
     or quake\fortress\maps directory. Then run quake.
     In the console, type "map hedge6" (without the
     quotes)"

If you are connecting to a Quake World server, then
stick the file in quake\qw\maps...

Please let me know any suggestions that you have for the
map; especially if it's TeamFortress related.  I've been
trying to make it balanced for TeamFortress play.

*** Strategies ***
******************

                   *** NEW ***
Team Fortress v2.1 adds the grappling hook.  I was going
to disable it on this level because I believe that it
completely disabled the entire concept of this level
(the maze and having to fight your way up through the
bases), but after many protests to the idea (and no
supporters) I decide to just make it so you couldn't get
into or out of the bases from the second floor or the roof.
(You can still get in through the side tunnels to the
roof....  Finding these are left as an exercise for the
reader. :)  )  In version 6, I also added some traps and
obsticles to hinder people from just grappling over the
maze.  If you see "Uh-oh!" be afraid. :)

I changed the frags/scoring system again.  If you kill
someone on the other team, you get 1 frag.  If you capture
a flag you get 10 frags, your teammates get 5 frags, and
the team gets 10 points.  I will make no claims that this
actually works as described, however.  Version 5 didn't
do the scoring right, and since I can't test the scoring
very well with only one player, I have wait until it's
released and on a server to actually see if it works as
intended.  I *did* use an enhanced TeamFortress Entity
Editor to change the scoring logic slightly, so I'm
optimistic about it working now.  (Don't go looking for
this new version of EntEd, as I haven't released it yet.
:)  But I will be shortly...)  Hopefully this new scoring
structure will encourage people to go for the flag and
defend their own while not being frustrating because you
get no credit for the 50 people you just sawed in half...

                   ***********

I have added a few TF v2.1 enhancements; mostly with
respect to many different, specialized messages.  I also
have the key icon at the bottom of the screen light up
you have a flag (in case you forget). :)  Another thing:
the big flame in the middle of the maze hurts.  A lot.
Don't touch it.  It really hurts.  Am I clear? :)

Yes, it's dark.  It's much lighter than the last
incarnation, so be thankful. :)  I was going for a
hedge maze/flame motif.

The idea for the forts was for the defending members of
the team to stick to the "high ground": the second floor,
the roof, the ledge in the back room, the two guard rooms
on the first floor, and the catwalk above the entry.  The
attackers obviously go through the maze, and try to
infiltrate the opponent's fort.  Since you don't get frags
for killing people, and only for capturing the flag, it
makes sense to have that your sole target while attacking.
While defending, some snipers should try to cover their
teammates while they're crossing the maze.

Check out the roof.  There's some great views from up
there.  On the sides are tunnels that wrap and put you
above the maze; definitely heaven for some snipers. :)

Again, the flags are in the basements, which are reached
via a descending platform with the key texture on one side
of the room on the second floor.  You then return on a
rising platform that takes you up to the other side of that
room.  Return it to the pool that's at the very back of
your roof.  If you can't find the pool, it glows. :)

I really hope that this is an enjoyable level, and that
I've addressed the number one complaint that I've had:
it's too dark.  The other complaint was that it was too
big and tended too make encounters more random one on one
than team efforts.  I've simplified things a little more,
and provided this strategies section to clarify my vision
for this level somewhat.  Also, I believe that the
darkness and unfamiliarity may have made the level more
complex than necessary.

If you have comments, my handle is Raistlan and my
email's above.  Suggestions are especially welcome, as
it's a lot easier when I know what's wrong, and what could
be "more right." :)
