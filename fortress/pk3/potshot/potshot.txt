* Other Info *
Description: 

A sniper duel map. Basically two snipers fight it out for frags. Only thing is, they can see each other, nor _directly_ kill one another. Instead they must trigger traps to kill their opponent, shoot helpless civvies running about, and avoid being raided by quaded, or invincible civilians :)

 
How to use this map:

Unpack potshot.bsp to your quake\fortress\maps directory.
Unpack dtree.mdl int your quake\fortress\progs\ directory
If you want to run it on a LAN server or just take a peek at
it, load quake with -game fortress and type "map potshot" in
the console to load it. 

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the potshot.bsp
file into your quake\fortress\maps directory.
