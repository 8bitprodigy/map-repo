Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must make it to reds flag room and take it back to their
base to capture it for 10 points, the red team must also do the same.
If the flag is dropped, it remains on the ground for 15 seconds and then
is returned to base.
Each team must prevent the other team from achieving their goals. Use
dets to open strategic points on the map for offence. Move defence 
to different positions to counter.
The map has 4 detpackable walls/boulders/grates in each base. The 
boulders underground are re-dettable allowing them to be opened and 
closed by detpacks. The grate can only be blown from below, and there
is another detpackable wall oustide. The last detpack point is above
the flag room and it can only be destroyed from above.
Beware of the bottomless pit (of death) underground. Fall down that
and yer life ends in a fountain of splattering blood droplets.
There are lots of places to conc/pipe/gren/rj to so have fun!
