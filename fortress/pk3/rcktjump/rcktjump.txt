Known Bugs/nonbugs	: I forgot to put an info entitity for the
			last jump - so I made the backpack tell you.
			Sorry for the inconvience...Also, I think
			that glquake handles the teleport texture
			differently, because it looks kinda strange 
			on the teleports on the floor. Don't know 
			why though.

Comments	 

		I made this map originally as a race, but I decided
		to make it more of a tutorial thing. I think it should
		be successful and being a comprehensive tutorial 
		on how to use explosive devices for increasing mobility. :)
		I also would like to point out that I made this map
		easier than I could have. A lot of the jumps could be
		made longer or higher, but I decided to make them 
		only long enough or high enough to get the general 
		idea across. Also - if you think the bonus jump is easy,
		I discovered a new jump that will get you even higher. 
		email me if you want the .map for the highest jump
		possible without being invulnerable or on quad. (I think.)
