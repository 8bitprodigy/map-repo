* General Overview *

Shouldn't take long to figure out, simple capture the flag for 10 
frags type of scoring system. The capture point is a little tricky.
You have to walk off the battlement and land on the roof of the 
forward resupply. Its a metal pad with a yellow light in the middle.
The signs may be a little hard to read for non GL users. Sorry guys,
I'm not much of an artist and MS Paint was my only tool. This will
most likely be the last version (for TF1 anyway) unless a major
bug shows up.

* Version Info *

1.00 	- 3 days and 300 cups of coffee was all it took.
1.01 	- Corrected flag skins for new TF-flag.
	- Removed medic spawn point from lower resupply.
	- Texture alligning.
	- Tried to make the lifts use the base/tech sound instead
	  of the clockwork/chain sound. Note the use of the word
	  "tried".
1.02	* first public release *
	- Removed a great deal of extra detail from the outside
	  area. *sigh* 1.01 looked so pretty too. Because I had
	  been testing this with a 3DFX card I hadn't noticed the
	  rather large buildup of polys in the outside area.
	  Thanks to Mad One for pointing out the fact that the 
	  entire base can vanish under a grey shroud if you stand 
	  in the right (or wrong?) place.
	- Texture alligning.
	- Successfully made the lifts use the base/tech sound 
	  instead of the clockwork/chain sound. Note the use of the
	  word "successfully".
1.03	- Texture alligning.
	- Removed one of the team only lifts from each base and
	  doubled the size of the remaining two.
	- Slowed the foyer area lifts from 350 to 200, should make
	  defence in that area a little easier.
	- Added more boxes to the foyer area as obstructions and as
	  sentry points.
	- Increased the armour gained from resupply packs to 100 in
	  the upper resupply and 50 in the lower resupply.
	- Added two 25 health packs to the lower resupply.
	- Added a small alcove opposite flag room passage as a 
	  defense point.
	- Changed the quad damage to a TF goal entity that gives
	  10 seconds of quad power every 3 minutes.
	- Moved spawn points so that red scouts spawn in the
	  forward resupply at the start of the game. Previously
	  at the start of the game, blue scouts spawned in the
	  forward resupply while red scouts spawned in the upper
	  resupply giving blue a slight head start.
	- Added TFgoals to upper resupply rooms to help keep enemy
	  players out.
	- Changed the sounds for taking and capturing the flag.
	- Placed the intermission point at a more interesting
	  location.
