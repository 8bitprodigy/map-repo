* Play Information *

This map does not work properly without the TeamFortress v2.65 QuakeC
patch, which can be downloaded from http://www.planetquake.com/teamfortress/
or from ftp.cdrom.com

Single Player           It's an example map.
TeamFortress            It WORKS.  You can play

* Construction *

Editor(s) used          Worldcraft
Known Bugs              None known.
Build Time              3 hours
Base:			Stolen blatantly from the HWHELL2 blue base.


INSTALLATION:

dss.map and dssinfo.txt are for mapmakers.  delete them if you're NOT a mapmaker.
dss.bsp and dss.txt(this) go in fortress/maps/

mapmakers READ dssinfo.txt and put dss.map with your .map files.


GAME PLAY:

A VERY good 1vs1 or 2vs2 player CTF map.  The flags and captures WORK.  Everything works.

The Dynamic Sizing System actually doesn't do much to change the map.
It gives access to a pent, a quad, and one resupply pack.  It is only for demonstration purposes.


Version Info:

DSS.BSP    The ONLY version.  I plan NO changes EVER.


PLEASE report any glitches not mentioned here.
