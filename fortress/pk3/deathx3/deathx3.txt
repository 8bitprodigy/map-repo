* Other Info *

  This is a 2 team capture-the-flag style map. Each team starts at a different
end of the map. In the center of the map is a large key (flag). Any player
who capture the flag and returns it to their home base scores 2 points for their
team.

  Whenever a player has the flag, all members of the other team get quad damage.

  There are three black squares protecting your base from enemy infiltration. 
If any player on the opposing team steps on one, they take 500 damage.

  A player with the flag cannot stand on any of the black squares on the ground,
except the ones protecting his own base.

  There are resupply points under the ramps inside your base.

How to use this map:
