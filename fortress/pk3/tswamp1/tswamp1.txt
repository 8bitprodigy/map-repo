* Game info *

	To start place pqr2.mdl, medpack.mdl, thekey.mdl and rings.mdl in your quake\fortress\progs.  Next place
pqr.wav in your quake\fortress\sounds\items.  Last put the tswamp1.bsp and
this txt file in your quake\fortress\maps directory.

	This map is designed for 3 Teams.   Red, Blue, and Green.  Do not pick yellow.  Don't say
I didn't warn you about it.

	There are 2 base, 1 RED base and 1 Blue base (they are mirror images of each other.)
The bases are side by side but inbetween them is a swamp which is guarded by the Green team (4)
The green team can't enter either the RED or BLUE base.  Inside the Red and Blue base is a key
which needs to be taken back to your base and it can be capped in the room beside the sniper loft
.  You cap on any of the caution pads.  Capping causes things to be activated and here is a list of them.


Armor: Capping here causes armor regeneration.  5 armor points every 5 seconds.
Medikit: Capping here causes health regeneration.  2 health points every 5 seconds.
Grenade: Capping here causes grenade regeneration.  1 detpack, and 1 grenade 1&2 every 30 seconds.
Rings: Capping here causes armor cycling.  Every 10 seconds your armor changes.  It starts with Kevlar,
	changes to Wooden, then to Blast, then to Shock, then to asbestos.  After that it starts over with Kevlar.
Key: Capping here awards the capper with 5 extra frags, this one is not removed and can be capped on multiple times.

Capping on any of the spots gives the whole team 10 frags.


	If you notice any problems or major things that need to be changed, feel 
free to email me (blog@hotmail.com) also if you like the level or just want
to know how I did anything, I will be glad to tell.
