Demos Replaced          : Nope

================================================================

Changes for Version 1.7 : -Yeah we did it! we made it box shaped! : (
-----------------------   -Now the level doesn't crash Glquake anymore.(God
			   only knows why this happened)
                          -There is a tunnel now connecting the bases.
                          -Fixed the individual frags error.
                          -Maphelp is now availiable.
Changes for Version 2   : -There is now glass at the window by entrance.
---------------------     -The doors should be alright by now, although
                           we don't exactly know why, suddenly.
                           We just spent  about 9 hours trying all 
                           possibilities...
                          -The roof area has now been seperated with rock
                           This should help to decrease possible greyout on weak 
                           machines and also speed up GL.
                          -Easy intrusion by RJ and GJ is no longer 
                           possible.
                          -The water exit is now only accessible by two switches.
                           press the first and wait for the barrier to retreat to
                           shoot the button that's in the tube.
                          -kind of fixed the 'non-glowing' wall for touchdown under GL
                          -restructured lower sniper's nest so enemy snipers can't shoot
                           people coming from the lower respawn.

Known Bugs              : There should be none right now - hopefully
                          Except that during the last test a sentry disappeared in the 
                          ramp room, probably because it dropped through the ground...?

Build Time              : 2 months with bigger and smaller pauses...(originally)
                          + again some weeks of horrendous cutting down and trying
                          of the initial design and at least 8 full days of 
                          VISing-sessions for the sake of a 'normal'
                          gameplay and presenting Version 2.
			 
GLVis'd			: NO - We don't think there's much sense to also see through
                          water if there's enough graphics to display anyway.
                          and second point: We don't  like it. Yeah it looks good but...

General things:
==============

Installation:
------------
unzip Contact2.zip to a temp directory
move  Contact2.bsp  into your quake\fortress\maps directory
move  thing.mdl    into your quake\fortress\progs directory


Performance:
-------------

If you own a rather fast computer (let's say a P120+ with (more than) 16 Meg) you might
 be able to increase your system performance quite a bit:

Just add to your command line:

	-r_maxsurfs 1200 (or more)
	-r_maxedges 3200 (or more)
        -heapsize 20000 (or more)
		

REMARKS:
--------

For all the Gl-ers out there: We tried to make Contact2 playable for Gl also 
                              but the thing is that we, as we started 
                              building, didn't have any opportunity to
                              test the map. We just got our 3D some days after Ver 1.7
                              and we couldn't know about the 'sky-hole' 
                              problems Glquake seems to have. The thing is
			      if we should cut up our map even more to
		  	      make it suitable for any kind of system we 
  			      would destroy the character entirely. I hope
 			      the design makes up for this.(what's left 
                              of it at least)
			      Well, the new seperation of the roof area should 
                              improve things a bit.

This map is also planned for Quake2-TF as soon as we find an appropriate 
editor/converter and have some info about it. If you have a prog and think 
it's really great please tell me.

Map overview:
-------------
Contact2 is a map recommended for approx 18 players, but stuff as many in there 
as you like ;)


The scenario:
Two bases situated half in water linked by an isle.(Well now the water 
                                                    is a mere puddle but...)

Contact2 is a classical Capture the Flag map (except perhaps that the flag 
 is a thing ;) ). 

This means:

 Get the enemy thing by going on top of the roof of their base and falling down 
 the tunnel to the basement.
 There either shoot the switch to open the water door or head up again....
 Touch down at the glowing wall with the tech symbols situated in your 
 ramp room / your lower sniper balcony.

Remarks:
--------

How do to open the water doors:
  - There are two doors. One in the floor of the cellar and one in the wall facing the 
    other base. The door in the floor is only opened from outside with a shootable 
    switch. The other one is opened by first pressing the button on the ramp. Then wait 
    for the striped barrier in the small tube to retrieve until a shootable button is
    revelaed. Hurry after shooting it.
