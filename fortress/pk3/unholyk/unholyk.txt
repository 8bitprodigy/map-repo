Other:
Playinfo                : This is not straight-CTF. You kidnap the other
                          team's princess and place her in your dungeon, the
                          central cell. The other team must come and rescue
                          her while also trying to kidnap your princess. The
                          game will be interesting, with teams shifting from
                          all-offense to all-defense, and back again. You
                          only need to touch your princess to return her home.

                          Your Bowing Knights will resupply you slowly but
                          they do not give grenades (to prevent gren spam)
                          so be sure you stock up before you leave the armory.

                          Two magic mirrors lead out of the armory. The left
                          one takes you to an upper area of your kingdom,
                          the right one takes you to a lower area.

Scoring                 : Scoring is achieved by:
                          1) Bringing the enemy princess to your Dungeon
                             Cell (5 initial team frags)
                          2) Keeping the enemy princess in your Dungeon
                             Cell (5 team frags every 30 seconds)
                          3) Rescuing your own princess (5 personal frags)

Secrets                 : There is a secret area in each Great Dining Hall.
                          It contains a Ring of Shadows and a box of rockets.
                          The Ring will hopefully help the offense get out
                          of the Great Dining Hall. The rockets respawn
                          slowly and is the only place where grenades can be
                          retrieved.

Tips                    : There is a slight bottleneck at the entrances if
                          you enter the castles normally. I suggest using the
                          water ways. The left side of the moat is a fast
                          way in. The right side is a fast way out of the
                          castle, via the drain in each Dungeon. You *can*
                          gren jump into the Dungeon using the drain,
                          it's not easy, but if I can do it so can you :}
                          Since these waterways in / out are so convenient
                          for penetrating the enemy kingdom, I didn't add any
                          demo-detonatable grates to them. Otherwise they
                          would be nearly inpenetrable with a decent defense.
                          There is a skylight provided on the "roof" for
                          rocket jumpers if they care to use that way in.
                          The sniper towers contain a sniper-only ressuply
                          bag. It's slow and *will* restock enemy snipers,
                          so be warned.
