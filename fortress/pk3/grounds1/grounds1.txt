I do not know of any errors besides the error where
sometimes a player may start in the enemy base.
There "is" a secret in this map and it's up to you to
find it. I used Worldcraft to complete this map.
If you have questions or comments or find any other
errors or mistakes in the map, please do not contact the
administrator in which you recieved the map from, he/she is not
responsible. Contact me at ctoth@wcoil.com
