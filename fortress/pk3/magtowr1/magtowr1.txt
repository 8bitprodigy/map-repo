======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag... errr Rune" map.

There are 2 teams to this map. The Imps (red) and the Smurfs (blue)

---Short Storyline---
The imps want the smurfs flag (which they mistook for an English rune) and the smurfs want the
imps flag (which they mistook for an Egyptian rune). The two teams bought big guns..
end of story :)


POINT SYSTEM:
10 frags for a capture

since the towers once belonged to two powerful Magi (hence smurfs and imps)
there are a few leftover surprises to the level
the flag is located between the tower tops and the capture point is behind the wind tunnel in
the top sniper nest with two BIG windows (the one with the piece of sky in the floor)
the towers have icky goo pouring from the top of the tower.. no one know what the magi intended
to use it for, but it makes a swell defense system :)
also, there is a wind tunnel (i mentioned it before i think) from the top sniper nest that leads
directly to the key... only catch - its one way, so coming down will be a problem
