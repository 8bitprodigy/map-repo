================================================================

* The Aim *

OK then, the aim of this level is simple, to get the flag from within the dungeon
of the opposing team and return it to the pool in the middle of your own castle.

There is one resupply pack in each castle, you can find it yourself.

There are 2 ways into the dungeon, and one main exit.

	1. Shoot the button on the wall within the castle to open the grating.
	2. Behind the castle in the moat, also doubles as the exit

There is a switch in the dungeon over the lava pit which brings up bars within the
dungeon to trap an escapee, one set of bars is at the end of the lava pit, and the other
is near where you fall into the dungeon from the castle.

You will notice 2 "sniper" towers at the end of the main bridge. On these towers are
buttons, which open up a lava pit within each tower and send the little gits falling
to their death! However, only the HWGUY can shoot these switches.
	

There are also 2 teleporters to get you out of the water.

Hope you enjoy!
