Details: 
	
-==SCORING==- 
A) 3 TEAM POINTS and frags are awarded each time the enemy flag is removed from its pedestal (not everytime it's touched). 
B) 7 TEAM POINTS and frags are awarded for the succeasful capture of the enemy flag.

-=Outlook=-
	Flags are on the upper floor of the bases. Capture the flags on the pedestal in the main ramp room. There is a sewer system that connects the two bases. Everything else is pretty standard.
	I kept the design of this map simple: straight forward "Capture the Flag". The bases are none too complex, but features wide halls to make for great fighting with few bottle-necks. There is no deck-to-deck sniping, rocks separate the view between the two bases. This, however, makes offensive sniping much more acceptable. I hope you enjoy it.
