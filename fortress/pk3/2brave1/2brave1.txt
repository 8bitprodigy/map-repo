Two teams (Scottish and English), the object is to capture the other teams Leader (King
or William Wallace) and place him in your prison.
The Leaders start in the throne room, and as long as they are on the throne their 
respective flags will be raised. If they are removed from the throne then the appropriate 
flag will lower. (A good check when you have just entered the game)
The grates in the underwater passages can be opened by a detpack, once open they can not
be fixed for that round.
BTW don't annoy your Leader while he is on the throne ; ).

Above all else just Have fun.

Brian (MIDORI[BH]).
