- Alternative flag-room routes
- Lava-filled tunnel
- Adjacent flag capture point rooms

Muahahahah!

=========================Misc. Info=============================

Thanks to TFS for the TeamFortress quakeC mod, and to id Soft.
for Quake, easily the best online multiplayer game ever created.
Also thanks to Wombat[EQ] (or should that be Earthquaker Wombat?)
for the sniper hole idea, Bear[SG] for wandering round cooing and
aha-ing just like last time :), and to the rest of [TG] who helped
me test the bloody thing till it worked properly.

Note:
I prefer to be contacted using ICQ if possible, since i'm usually
online 24 hrs a day :)
