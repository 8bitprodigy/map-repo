* Play Information *

This map does not work properly without the TeamFortress v2.14 QuakeC
patch, which can be downloaded from http://www.telefragged.com/teamfortress
or from ftp.cdrom.com, but I suggest getting the latest version which at
this time is v2.5.

Single Player           : Uh I guess, but there's no fun in that!
Cooperative             : Same thing.
Deathmatch              : Sure, but once again absolutely no fun.
TeamFortress            : YES!!!
Difficulty Settings     : No
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : Yupper, The good ole Bill textures
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : Well it's from scratch, but hunted was the inspiration
                          (along with my deep hatred for Bill Gates :D ).
Editor(s) used          : Quark (Quake Army Knife), EntEd 
Known Bugs              : None
Build Time              : Hmm well took about a day and a half to make, and compile
                          time was about 25 minutes for QBSP, VIS, LIGHT on a P133 
                          w/32 RAM
Thanks to               :Id, The TF guys for creating a kick-ass MOD, David Ramirez
                         (Urban Warfare) and Jim Kaufman (creator of well, and the rock)
                         for helping with my questions, Roger Soder for the inspiration
                         from hunted, and all those who helped me w/ JFK which failed,
                         your help has not been forgotten.
