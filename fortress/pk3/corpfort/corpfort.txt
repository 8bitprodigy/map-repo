* Construction *

Base                    This is a non decorative war map. I had nothing
                        fancy in mind, but to accomedate a large group
                        of fellow warriors in a common cause eg.[fight
                        our way in and steal the flag, or at least work
                        it back to our fort to score!]If you score "Your
                        team gets 10 seconds of invisibility" and 10 points
                        This makes more of a challenge for the snipers!
                        I think that is important because if the server
                        is big enough you might could have maybe15 or 20
                        snipers :) on each side.and no class limitation.
                        What ever class you want to play, there is a place
                        for it here.As I said before, don't look for the
                        banasters or the window trim or a tea service.
                          This is strictly a war map. All doors are coded
                        and all backpacks are too, except the ones inside
                        any secure doors, so if you can sneak past them as
                        they are coming out then you deserve a drink of water!
Build:  I did not have too much trouble whipping this out, however I haven't
        tried to conquer arghlite yet.Extra light sampling took a while on this
        one.

* Other Info *
Description: 
          This is similar to all the rest. you have two forts opposite each
         other, with a pretty mean snipage setup on the WALL!
         Steal their flag and head for your fort's upper middle wall!
         There is backpacks abounding , some with ammo , some with armor
         and some with some of everything including both grenade types and detpacks!
         This is basically I guess a tribute to the 2fort4 tradition,but I didn't
         copy paste anything here That I didn't origanally construct.
         There is only 2 coventional ways in for either team.
      1. You fight your way up the ramp provided at the left of the opposition
       and go through the door on the center building and down the spiraling
       ramp ways into the lower part of the fort where the flag room is and I
       might add probably heavily guarded. {or}
      2.You can cross the bridge in through the front and to the hall on the
       left, but you will have to first trigger the large platform to come
       up and then ride it down. Flagroom will be the first room on the right
       and I might add probably heavily guarded.
 Except to no.1---You could go through the front door and to the right, where
            there is another platform you can ride to the roof.
      AT any rate you can rest assured that the defense on either side will
      never run out of ammo.As long as there is a turn out on this map.It 
      could be fun[[[[PLenty of ROOM]]].No special stuff. No teleporters or
      secret doors.Now get in their and crush all that oppose!
      This map is freeware. Enjoy it and remember if you don't like the map
                     It is not the end of the world.
          
Installation: Use winzip and extract the corpfort.bsp file to your:
              usually c:/quake/fortress/maps folder c being the name of the
              drive in which you keep quake.
              You should have the standard wavs I have used in your id1 folder
              and your fortress/sound folder I used lock4.wav and protect3.wav
              and cap1.wav and cap2.wav for pickup I used medkey.wav and 
              runekey.wav.everything except cap1 and 2 will play directly
              out of the quake/id1/sounds/misc  or /items folders.
              cap1 and 2 are rigged simply that in fortress/sounds.
               Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                      
  P.S. I have enclosed these wav sounds and if you want you can probably
     rig to run them right out of fortress here are the codes i programmed
     them with. Cap1.wav and Cap2.wav simply run from the fortress/sounds
     folder lock4.wav runs from my id1/sounds/weapons folder.
       Runekey.wav runs from my id1/sounds/misc folder.
       Medkey.wav  runs from my id1/sounds/misc folder.    
       protect3.wav runs from my id1/sounds/items folder.
 There you are! I found them this way so I assumed they were put there in all standard quake.
  If not then these simple instructions along with the wav's I have provided will work!
