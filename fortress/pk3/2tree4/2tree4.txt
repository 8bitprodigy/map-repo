			  if you try my map, give me your opinion, good or bad. I want
			  to know if it's just perfect, if I could improve something 
			  or if I just have to stop doing levels. thanks in advance.


Installation: 	2tree4.bsp goes in your map directory
		Someone mailed me 'cause he didn't have Lock4.wav so I packed it within,
		put it in id1/sounds/items
		I don't know if ball2.mdl is standard so I incorporated it as well, it goes 
		in id1/progs

* Play Information *

It's a 2team-flag capture map. The flag is easy to found, but you don't capture it 
where you take it. It goes in the room behind the red portal for reds and behind the 
two blue columns for the blues. When you'll see it you'll recognize it. When you capture,
the block under the drop off point opens and there is a magic ball inside. Capture grants
you 15 points and 10 for your team. So now, capturers aren't just accumulating points for
fragging teammates. 

You can swim to the flag but first you have to blow off the door that's in the first 
room after the water corridor (detpack the computer next to the door).
There is a laser barrier just after. It won't hurt you but it alerts the
enemies that you are coming. There is no way to shut it down (sorry). You can't dive back 
from the flag in the water, but you can do it in the well. There is a grate that opens
with the button next to it. It's a toggle door. So you can open it when you come, get the 
flag and then dive to swim your way back to your base. 

There is armor and life regenerators in the first room. They will work for each team, 
but they are very noisy, so don't plan to do half the way, have a rest in enemies base 
and then go for the flag, but you can stop a few seconds to recover some life.

Design:	 	I keeped the outside area of my first map cause I found it nice. It's huge 
		and highly detailed so you shouldn't run my map on a 286SX!
		That's why it took 10 HOURS! to vis to compile. (standards light and qbsp
		times) The first version took three days to vis. I added some visblockers
		and gained 60 hours!
		The bases are similar but not still different. Architecture is basically 
		the same, but design is different and here and there you can found a stair
		instead of a lift.
		You like the flag room model? It's an idea of lolo.@bluewin.ch (Thanks lolo!) I never 
		saw a model before so if someone already did it, thanks for the idea too.
