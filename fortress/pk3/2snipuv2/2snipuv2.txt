Description             : A Team Fortress sniper only map.
	This map has two large futuristic style bases, seperated
	by a pool of slime.  While you cannot just cross into the
	opposing base, their are a number of other ways to get 
	over there and cause some major havoc.  Much time and
	effort has been spent perfecting this map, the previos
	version has been considered by many "the best sniper
	map they've ever played" I hope to make those players 
	smile with this remake.
Special Thanks		: Matthew Ayres and Paul Hsu for their
		awsome quake editor QOOLE (rock on boys!)
			: Al Bahr Enterprises for the creation
		of Ented, I never would have figured out TF ent's 
		without it.
			: Krylic for convincing me to play more 
		sniper, and letting me use his computer for all 
		this quake playing and editing.
			:  Sean Werkema for QUBE
			: All those snipers who gave me advice
		for this remake. HAVE FUN EVERYONE!
