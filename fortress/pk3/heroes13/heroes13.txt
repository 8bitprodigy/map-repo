============================= Story ============================

	Once upon a time, long ago there was a kingdom ruled by 2
kings, a blue legion king and a red legion king. The two kings 
were best of allies and kept the land at peace from the evil mage, 
Myraal. But one day Myraal came to the possession of two tainted 
ancient, silver and gold ruins. With these ruins he cast an old 
spell on the two kings. The kings and their armies became fierce 
enemies and as the battles went on all the dead knights souls were 
captured by Myraal for his own evil plans. One day 6 knights were 
accidently released from the spell and they realized what had 
happened. Anger, fear and revenge filled them with strength to 
confront Myraal and put an end to him. A huge battle took place and 
the knights were successful at defeating the evil mage and with the last 
bit of strength they had left, they carried the ruins to their own castles
to free the dead souls of their comrades. But the evil taint on the 
ruins infected them and they were turned to statues. Luckily the ruins 
were safely in the castle dungeons. Unfortunately a mix up occurred and
now the red and blue legion have a new war to fight over.... to retrieve 
their ruins from the enemies castle and return it to theres to free their 
Lost Heroes souls.... and this is how the battle continues forever.

Known Bugs:                  Spike Traps sometimes don't work in Quakeworld, 
                             especially when game gets laggy. Water area in gorge feels funny in QW.
                             When map is started in server, qwsv prints out "targetname is not a field."
                             I don't know what is causing this problem but it doesn't seem to be a big issue.

======================= Installation ======================== 

This archive contains 2 files:
-heroes13.txt  You are reading it now.
-heroes13.bsp  The map file. Place it with your other TeamFortress maps.

NOTE: You have to run quake with a -winmem 12 command to run this map. If you are running 
quakeworld then you don't have to worry about this.

======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is CTF style map. You run to your enemies castle dungeon, grab the flag and run back to your castles
sniper nest to capture it. You get 10 frags and 10 team points for every flag captured. Also there are 3 traps. One in the waterfall which 
either the red or blue team can use. This trap when triggered, electrocutes anyone in the water. And there is a spike trap at 
either teams flag. Also the statues in the basements resupply the player with health. 
And lastly there is a sniper box in the gorge, across from the
waterfall, the team that has control of this box would be very dominative.

======================= Misc Information ======================== 
I would like to thank TFS for making TeamFortress, Yahn Bernier for making BSP, Id Software for making Quake and Buck Naked and K2rbka of Clan Ciab and the rest of clan ciab that were there, for helping me play test this map. 
Also, thank you Kevlar for helping me fix the "the crazy dissapearing brush bug."
