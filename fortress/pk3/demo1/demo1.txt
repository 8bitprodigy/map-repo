  This is a two team capture-the-flag map, but with only one class, the
Demoman.  Simply grab their falg and return it to yours.  A capture
gives 10 points to the team, 10 frags to the player who captured, and 5
frags to everyone else on the team.

-=For Server Ops=-

  This map has had the gravity 'tweaked'.  Please do not run this map
on a server that overrides gravity, because it will ruin the play.
