* Other Info *

	There are four files in the zip

	- crowns1.txt (this text file)
	- crowns1.bsp
	- crown.mdl
	- qmark.mdl

Put crowns1.bsp into your fortress/maps dir.  Both of the .mdl files
go in your fortress/progs dir.

	Feel free to use the crown.mdl and qmark.mdl in your
own TF maps.  They both have 4 skins, 0 - 3, which are the colors,
in order, of the 4 TF teams.

	This is my first Quake map.  It's almost a CTF map,
except for two differences:

	- They're crowns, not flags (why? beats me :)
	- To get to the enemy's crown, you first must steal
	  their key.

	To get their key, go through their front door and down the
LEFT corridor.  Then take a right, and you'll be in the general
area. Once you have their key, go back to their main entrance area
and go down the RIGHT corridor.  Unlock the door, grab the crown,
and take it back to your base.  The dropoff point is the circle
with your team's logo on it in the room at the bottom of the ramp
down your left corridor.  (Blue team's logo just happens to be a
crown; that doesn't have anything to do with the crowns in this
map.)

	Once you unlock their door, it stays unlocked until their
crown is captured.  So, if you get killed and lose their crown and
it gets returned, you DON'T have to go back for their key.

	When you have their key, the key icon lights up.  When
you have the crown, YOU light up. :)

	When you use the flaginfo alias, it will only tell you about
the crowns.  I would have liked to have been able to make it so that
it told you about the keys as well as the crowns, but that is
impossible with the way the flaginfo code is set up.  There is a place
in each crown room (the spinning ?) where you can check on the keys.

	Each capture is 10 frags for you and your teammates and
10 team points.

******************
*** Strategies ***
******************

	There are three windows at the front of each base for
snipers.  Another area for snipers is the wall between the
bases.  Heavy weps guys could hang out in the tunnel through
that wall.

	There is plenty of room for sentries in the key and
crown areas.

	But whatever works for you...;)

	You might get the idea to stay in the enemy's crown room
while one of your teammates captures the crown, but I think
this would be a very bad idea.

	Spies change color and skin.  When you get the enemy's key,
you do not lost your disguise.  You do lose it when you get the
crown.

	Sorry, no grappling hook. :)

	Oh, by the way, there's a wall in each base you can blow
up with a detpack...(if you find that wall, you'll soon see
why I disabled the grappling hook)
