* Game Play *

If you know 2fort4-5 then you know how to play this map.
A couple of new things added:
1) The enemy flag located in the basement has two entrances to the flag 
   room; the main corridor and the Vent located just outside the door (Shoot to
   open)
2) The Spawn rooms have a Push effect to keep the spawn camping down.  If you try
   and enter the enemy spawn room you will be pushed back out.
3) Under the bridge is the water access to the fort.  The water entrance door has
   to be shot before it will open.

 * Other Info *

Included in the zip are a set of binds that, if used can help the team play aspect
of this map. 
To use them copy "bam-d.cfg", "bam-o.cfg" and "bam.cfg" to your quake/id
Connect to a server running the BaM map 
Bring down the console and type "exec bam.cfg"

F11 will change between Defence and Offence Binds and
Keys F1 to F10 to display the messages bound to them. (In say_team mode)


 * Final Words *

I had a limited time in which to build this level so some things I wanted
to include got left out... Hmm, maybe BaM5.

Please Email me with any suggestions, Bugs etc , Thanks.

Above all just have fun.

Brian (BaM]Midori[BH).
