Gameplay :  Your mission is to get the ball and return it to the capture point in your base, which is recognizable as a 4x4x1 array of small square lights on the floor somewhere in your base. I suggest you familiarize yourself with the various capture points before playing the map competively. This is a four team ball game, in the spirit of spazball and foozball. These are both excellent maps, and spaz4 is far beyond anything I could ever do. This is my humble offering to this genre of "ball" maps.

Copyright : This map is my own work, and I do not wish for any changes or modifications to be done at this time. If I want to, I will give the map source to certain individuals if they request it, but other than that no changes should be done. This includes converting from a bsp to a map file or otherwise decompiling, distributing as ones own work, or something else like that. Have fun, frag your friends, I'm out.
