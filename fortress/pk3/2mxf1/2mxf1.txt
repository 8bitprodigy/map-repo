Release Notes:
 This is a Capture the Flag Team Fortress map. The flags are located underground and the
 goals are located on the roofs. What makes this map different is that the forts accually
 resemble forts. It also has a few defensive traps.

 In some places the map will exceed the maximum number of surfaces allowed. When it does, you
 see grey. This is not a map bug but a default limitation of Quake or QuakeWorld. To fix this,
 add r_maxsurfs 1200 to a script file that is run BEFORE the map is loaded. I'm not sure of the
 result of QLQuake. If someone has a problem AND the solution, please e-mail me.
