Title                   : Shanghai Noon v2
Filename                : shn2.bsp
Author                  : dp
Description             : ctf with two castles and catapults.
================================================================
added in v2: 
made more paths in between the bases, to avoid choke point effect (Night Hunter designed it all)

* Play Information *

TeamFortress            : Yes, about 16 players _should_ work well
New Graphics            : All new, textures taken from ikblue.wad and the following dm maps: 								Auhdm2, Exdm5, Lilith, Mjdm1pro, Xl1dm6 (i think most of these 								used textures from quake3/daikatana/hexen2 etc.) thanks
				
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 1.6 and 2.1, q3radiant
Known Bugs              : the catapult doesnt always shoot you up the top, just stand at the very 							back. some textures need work, but doesnt really affect gameplay                  
Details: Capture the flag, two teams. Flag is on second floor of each castle, accesible by going up lifts or spiral or being catapulted up, cap point is between your lifts. The flag return time is 1 minute 9 seconds (you figure it out).
from the respawn the teleporters under the windows lead you into the pipe, the others into the main entry/stair room
the flag room bars cannot be opened

CATAPULT EXPLANATION
you can only use the catapult in front of the enemy castle. the button on the catapult is not shootable, you need to have one person press the button while the other person is sitting on the catapult spoony bit (towards the back works best). presto! the button resets in 30 seconds


Installation: put into fortress/maps dir (use "quake -game fortress +map shn2" - or nowadays most clients will let you "gamedir fortress" "map shn2" - to play)
