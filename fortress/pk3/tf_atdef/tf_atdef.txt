* Other Info *

This map is my first level design attempt for Quake. I have tried most
of the current batch of level editors, but feel most comfortable with
Thred. This map can be played deathmatch, although it really should be
use for the Team Fortress patch. If you haven't got this patch, I
suggest you get it right now! (see top for WWW address)

* How To Play This Map (Team Fortress) *

First of all you need to unzip the .BSP file into your QUAKE\ID1\MAPS
directory (creating the MAPS directory if you haven't got it!)

This map starts with the attackers (team 1) in a small building on the
right of the map, and the defenders (team 2) on top of a fairly large 
castle on the left of the map. The idea is for the attackers to get 
onto the top level of the castle and fall down a chute to enter the 
dungeon coplex. From here the attackers must negotiate a large lava 
infested room with 3 exits into the defenders flag room. Once an 
attacker has grabbed the flag, he/she needs to fall down one of the 
two holes in the floor. This teleports the player to a small corridor 
exiting just above the water outside near the castle. Once out of the 
water via the ramps, just take the flag to inside the attackers start 
building and onto the small blue platform in the middle of the lower 
floor. The attacking team will receive some points for the capture of 
the defenders flag. Then its time to do it all over again. Its best 
when a game is timed and the teams are swapped over so that both teams 
have a go at defending/attacking. Have fun.

This is the first of several Team Fortress maps which I hope to release.
The next map I am working on is an underwater complex with two identical
team bases. Hopefully this will be out within a few weeks.
