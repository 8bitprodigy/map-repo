Release Notes:

The 2 forts are different (I don't like the idea of having the same thing on
both sides). Both flags are in a room in the basement with good defenses. The
goal is on both teams' roof (the center defensive location). There is a rare
instance where gray matter will appear. This level works with 32 players.
