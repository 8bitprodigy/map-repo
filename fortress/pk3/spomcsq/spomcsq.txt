* Detailed Description *

Well, it's another square map but it has a twist! There are two spectator areas for people who
connected to the server without going to spectator.  It can be also used when you wanna play 
a 2 on 1 or series of matches where the people could just sit and watch.  Have fun, email me
if anything messes up badly.  Also, I'm trusting you guys that you wont spam from the ceiling
part, that was just designed for spectating with a nice view.  I hope you guys play fair on this
map.
