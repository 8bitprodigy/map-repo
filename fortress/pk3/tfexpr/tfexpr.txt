Description             : A 2fort style map with a smaller floor plan
                          and some interesting architectural variations.
			  This map is designed for a lot of fraging and 
			  is intended to be difficult to cap on if the
			  defensive plan takes advantage of the intended 
			  architectural designs.

Details:

Standard 2fort info-

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.
It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:
The blue team must capture the red flag from the basement of the enemy 
base, and take it to the battlement of the blue base.
The red team must capture the blue flag from the basement of the enemy 
base, and take it to the battlement of the red base.
Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.
If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it remains
for 30 seconds after which it returns to the basement.  Unlike standard CTF,
team members cannot return the flag by running over it.

Architectural info-

There are several key design features that make this map nicely designed for a defensive 
battle.  
First, the platform above the entrance to the flag chamber is ideal for the engineer to set
up shop.  It is also easily accessible to the resupply room making speedy level 3 sentry's 
possible.  
Second, there is only one way out of the basement and that is via the spiral staircase 
which is housed in a rectangular structure. This makes it very difficult for the speed 
demon scout to shoot up the staircase without losing his footing and falling to the floor
below and into the arms of the defending units.
The entrance to the base is designed in a way so as to force all incoming units to pass through
an alcove in the front.  This alcove has openings above for snipers to pick off unsespecting units 
as the enter.  This sniper positions protected from enemy sniper fire from the oppostion's base 
making it easier for the defending sniper to concentrate on the task at hand.
One offensive note: Each base has hidden within it a Quad damage item accessible for flag carriers 
or whoever might find them.

Enjoy!
