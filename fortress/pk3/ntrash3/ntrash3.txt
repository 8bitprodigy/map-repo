description             : TeamFortress v2.5 Quake Map

        has interesting features, when you're a demoman try going into the
room reachable by the smaller lift from the main room (room with big and
small lifts) enter the room it deposits you at and throw a few mirv grenades
into the pit, turn to the window and watch as foolish bridge-crossers are
torn to bits by the grenade shower.

        update: longer bridge so that dorks can't just sprint across it
they must face the cannon!
        doors on respawn rooms so no idiots can take your stuff.
        wind tunnels on cannon openings so grenades don't kill cannon
        operators.
