Once again this is a two team map but with 2 goals for each team to achieve.

The Score Machine goal must be activated before the bonus goal can be achieved.

The Score Machine key is in your base on the second level in the locker, use
this key in the enemy's basement computer to start the Score Machine.
Activating the Score Machine will give 5 frags, once activated the score machine 
Cannot be trigged again (When you cant pick up the score key its because the
Score Machine is already running) until the enemy has started their machine. Ie
It toggles back and forth.
 
Once the Score Machine is activated it will give out 1 Point every 30 seconds
that it is active and also the bonus key will become available.
The Bonus key has to be taken from the enemy's basement to the computer in the 
Lift room (Middle of the Map) (You have to take the Lift to get up there) this will
Give the team the 10 frag bonus , and will return the key so you can give it another go.

If the other team start the Score Machine their scoring will start and yours will stop,
Also the bonus key area will be sealed so if the bonus key returns to their base the only
Way to get it back is to start the score machine again.

The two gates in the middle can be open and closed two ways 500 dammage on the lower
buttons will do the trick (So they are a litle rusty) or just push the button in the
control room above the gate (Enter inside the gate) (Your choice).

Have fun.

Brian (MIDORI).
