* File Info *************************

	There are six (6) files in the zip

	- xcaliber.txt (this text file)
	- xcaliber.bsp

Put these into your fortress\maps

        - cbd-armr.wav   I dunno who made this, but I caught it floating
			 around on undernet (#wavs'r'us) It's great!
			 The telefrag one is even better! (dumbass!)

This wav file goes in fortress\sound\items

        - xcaliber.dem   This is the demo...useful if you want me to show
			 you where flags are, where they go & the great
			 architecture

The demo file goes in your fortress directory. In console, type playdemo xcaliber

        - cbd-tele.wav   In fact, I'll just add it for the hell of it

	- xcaliber.map	 This I am putting here BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND ANY
			 OTHER MAP OUT THERE TO HELP ME LEARN AND NO ONE WOULD
			 HELP (except sniprwar.map, thanks guy!)
			 So I am letting my source out in hopes that mapnewbies
			 might use it to learn, and that a pro might look at it
			 and offer me valuable criticism!

* Game Play **************************

This is my second Quake map, and my first 'big' one, so send your good comments
and opinions to me, and the rest go to Xodus

The object of this map is to get the enemies flag and return it to your
main room on the upper deck. What I really wanted to do is redo the entire
bottleneck layout of most 2fort4 type maps. I count no less than 5 ways into
the enemy fort, 4 ways to the key (2, maybe 4 ways out) and so with all of
these ways, I made the Main Royal Hall a very elegant bottleneck in itself.
I have no idea what defense will do, but I see this room as IT.

Also, and it is finally time for it, I used Xodus' idea of 100% full resupply.
This will cut down on waiting for others to grab it, and it will just let
you grab and go play which is what we play quake for. The respawn supply bags
give out one grenade of both types, the Boom! bag in the back gives out MAX
grenades and one detpack since TF2.666 has the "let the old one go 'fore ya
set the new one". (The Boom! is from Oppose1 and is my tip of the hat to
a great map & mapmaker! It's my fave!)

Oh, and I had fun setting up the front gates (doors) to where they do open
for their own team from the outside (both teams from the inside) and can also
be detpacked by the other team.

And the green thing in the far back is a pot bale. I had the texture and brushes
just LOOK like bales, so go figure...

Again, I always loved elaborate architecture when making maps for Doom2 and
of course Quake let me do so much more.
I did run into brush limits on this one so I had to del a lot of what I had
(bsp time 2 freaking hours! Didn't even attempt to vis that puppy) and I hope
everone likes my lighting (I almost called the map Twilight. I never name a
map until I'm done with it)

Note: I used to be in [CG]Clan Gangrene, and MadMike (The Wall) and Brewman
(The Maze) are both mapmakers, so I wonder if CG now has a map record? hm?
Greets to them and to CG, but KIN could blow you guys away! hehe (well, maybe
not madmike...he's scary like lord z....)

* Strategies ****************************

Offense:	1st minute scouts can go in water way either side (water hole
		or up the hill) run in, grab flag, run out main gate which will
		open for you, and in thru your own gate which will close behind
		you. Once the Gates are detpacked, scouts will have a field day!
		Scouts rule!
	Demomen:Det the gate! How you get past the main room if there are any
		sentries on the upper deck is up to you.
		Of course, grenjump to the large battlement or if you are good
		like me, pipe to top sniper deck for picking off easy sniper kills
	Snipers:I have given you wonderous places! Abuse them! And stop those
		damn demomen from detting your gate!
	Flagrun:when going for the flag, use those dark spaces in the long ramp
		and also there's the back tunnel (cool door!)

Defense:	MY LORD, USE THAT MAIN ROOM! Set sentries! Set pipes! Get on that
		upper deck and blow those enemies by remote control!
		If your flag gets taken, use the teleport to get to better pos-
		ition quickly! Because of the main room, I did not really make
		a long flaghall, so once that flag is grabbed, it is on its
		way up.
		And beware, the elevator shaft is PERFECT for the gren1jump or
		a 2pipe jump.
		And unless they rjump over it, or get on the upperdeck, that
		bridge in the main room is the only way to the flag, so keep
		your eyes on it.

Of course the grappling hook is disabled in this map. Map is NOT designed for it!
(Only map I've seen the grapple work well in is The Street)
