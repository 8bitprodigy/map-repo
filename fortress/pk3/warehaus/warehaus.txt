* Other Info *

This map is designed to be played by two teams. Each team has there own
base. The objective is to get the enemy's flag from their basement and
return it to the platform in your base while keeping the enemy from getting
your flag.  You get 2 points for getting the flag and 8 for returning it.
It won't be easy.
