	This is an update of cavern1.bsp. In one day I discovered two bugs. One, the red flag didn't glow like it was supposed too. Two, there was a brush misalignment in on of the blue respawns.


Description:


	Each teams' flags are upstairs. Scoring occurs when one team take their opponents flag back to their own base for the capture. The "cap point" is the sqaure in the middle of each team's sniper nest. Each capture is 10 points.

Flag Room - Each flag room contains a pool of lava spanned by a narrow bridge. The flag is across the lava, in the extreme back of the room. The lava pool is there as a hindrance, not a defensive mechanism. It is shallow, and anyone may easily hop out at the edge. When the your team's flag is captured, the bridge in your flag room drops down into the lava for 30 seconds. This is to give the flag room defense time to reset itself after losing the flag previously.

Respawns - Each team has two respawn/resupply rooms. Inside each are backpacks for Armor/ammo, and 4 health boxes. These packs do not give type 2 grenades. There are two additional backpacks upstairs near the flag room for the convenience of the defenders there. These packs give low amounts of health, armor, ammo, and grenades, and have a longer waiting period than the packs downstairs.

Flags - Once dropped, flags will stay down for 40 seconds waiting to be picked up again. After this time they return.


Thanks to the guys from QVT and TrF that helped me test out the map and gave input/suggestions.
Special thanks to Cataclysm(QVT) for letting me use that linux box of his to compile this monster.





Enjoy,
