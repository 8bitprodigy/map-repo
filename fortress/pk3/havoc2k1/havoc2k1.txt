* Other Info *

This map is designed to be played by two teams. Each team has their own
base. The objective are:-

1. To enter the enemy base and damage their control room. (top floor) 
2. To steal the oppenents flag and return it back to your teams drop off point. 

  In this map there are several buttons :-

1. The first is hidden behind a different textured section of wall inside
the oppenents main door then to the right.
function:- 
This will open the grate under water. (team only)

2. The second button is the same as the orginal version of Havoc6 and is
on the first floor above the main entrance
function:-
This will "SLOWLY" open the control room door. (top floor)

3. Flag room button (red bar) 
function:-
This will raise a section of floor to allow use of the wind tunnel to
the top floor.

4. The 5 red buttons in the control room.
function:-
This will raise the grate to allow capture of the flag.

SPECIALS.

Unlike the orginal version the 3 resupply points on each in each base are 
only usable by the owning team.

The brown coloured grates at either end of the bridge once blown will allow 
access into the water tunnel of that base without the water grate needing to
be operated.

The back room grate (ground level) is shootable a will require 150+ damage before
it will open. it will shut again after a short period of time.

In the middle room there is a section of wall that can be jumped into which will 
teleport the player to the roof outside of each base. (look for different texture)

The control room has two panels that can shot by the oppenents team

1. the map against the far wall this when damaged will give 1 frag
2. a section of the computer to the left of the first panel which will give 2 frags

Both require different amounts of damage to activate and also different amounts of 
time before they become shootable again.

If the oppenents flag is caputured your team will all recieve 10 frags.

If you ever played the orginal version of Havoc6 you will pick up this map without
any problems but the orginal was mainly based for the classes of sniper, soldier 
and demoman. This version should cater for all classes and hopefully allow for each
classes to proform well. 

If this map is to be used in a clan game both sides should get to know all the hidden things
with in this map. There isn't anything like in 2tech4 with ultimate power ups just nice 
simple things. (what you want more...??) tough.... The only power ups you'll find are in 
the main respawn room , the bottom/basement room and ramp between lvl 1-2.

You may also get a surprise if your playing it on the internet and you stand out in the 
middle of the bridge long enough.
(please don't email me about this last item as i cant give any further advice on this, 
But if your playing and i'm on the oppersite team please try standing still outside 
when both teams have quad and see what happens..!!!)

How to use this map:

Copy the havoc2000.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map havoc2000" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the havoc2000.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory.



N.B.
Server admins
I would recommand the max number of players be limited to 24 if you find this level crashes
due to max ent 512 errors.
