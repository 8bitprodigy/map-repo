======================= Game Play ========================

This is a TeamFortress "Capture the Flag" map.

The usual senario infiltrate the enemy base, capture the flag
and return it to your own base to score.  A word of warning this map
is very much team orientated you will need to use teamwork to rack up
points.

POINT SYSTEM:

10 Points for capturing the oppositions flag.

======================= Misc Information ========================
