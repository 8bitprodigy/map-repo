* Game info *

	The game play is simple, there are 2 teams.  The first person to enter 
the map (join team, and leave respawn room) starts a 5 min timer.  After the
5 min is up, the door between that teams base and the neutral area will open.
Then you must wait until the other teams door opens.  In each base is a Key,
you must enter the enemy's base and take their key back to where yours is.
Your team gets 10 frags and 10 points (so you know how many caps have been done)

	Caping the key results in everyone respawning.  To counter the cheat of 
double caps, a grate appears over the flag and will not go away untill the key 
returns.  Also, capping results in the doors closing for a few min.

	NOTE: Every min a message pops up sayning how much time is left on the 
door (I like that feature).  Also when the door opens, take a look at it.  It's
is unique (at least I have not seen one like it before)

N.B. The grappling hook has been removed in this level.

	If you notice any problems or major things that need to be changed, feel 
free to email me (blog@hotmail.com) also if you like the level or just want
to know how I did anything, I will be glad to tell.
