Capture the flag style map: two teams, two flags. The flags are in enemies base, on a pyramid. They go
on your base, but you must not take the main entrance... Follow the one on the right after the bridge.

Features summary:
-Big Map, for big teams...
-Big tunnel network that leads everywhere
-Three detpackables points: The door in the first room underwater. The grate to the flag may be detpacked to
 stay open. A secret door behind the pyramid (maybe opened and closed with detpacks). The two first give one point
 to fellow demo who blowns them.
-Two Respawns rooms per team, with three respawns points. 
-Huge outside area with complex architecture, rocks, arch, gondola, bridge, river....
-A secret door will open on capture (just under the capture point: resupply, small quad)
-Architecture allows all classes to be useful...
 -Detpackable doors to demo
 -Multi-level zones to Rocket Jump on
 -Underwater way for spies to infiltrate
 -Complex architecture to build sentries
 -Miradors for snipers to shoot at will
 -A mix of small and big areas for others classes to run and kill around
