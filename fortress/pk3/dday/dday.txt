Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

It is a command point style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must capture various command points including a V2 rocket site,
the gun at Navarone, an advanced weapons research facility, and a german held village.

The red team must hold all the command points and prevent the Allies from taking territory.

Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.

There are objective dependant respawns available. This means if your team owns the V2 site then
some of your teammates will respawn there.

The bridge near the village is a valuable objective. The red team recieves 2 points for every 
30 seconds that the bridge stands, while the command points are only worth 1 point per 30 seconds.
The bridge can only be blown up once so protect it well. The blue team receives 2 points every 
30 seconds that the bridge is in rubble.

There is a quad damage inside the Advanced weapons research lab. The quad respawns every 30 
seconds. The door to the lab is locked and the key is at the V2 rocket site ( on the other 
side of the map). The point of this is to take the fighting away from just the bridge area.
Once the Key has been picked up and the carrying player killed, the key will return in 15 
minutes. So basically the key will remain where ever you dropped it until somebody picks it up.

Have fun and send me bug reports.

If ya like it I'll make a version for TF2.
Later!!
