======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map designed for up to 3 players on 4 different
teams. There are no flags on this map, and therefore no way to gain
frags other than killing your puny opponents.

There are 4 teams to this map. 
The blue team fights up to 3 on 3 with the red team. Likewise, the
yellow team fights with green team in a parallel arena up to 3 on 3.

NOTE: The arenas can be linked if 1 team in each arena votes on it by
pressing the button in their respawn. Also note the arenas have a
different lighting situation; one arena being the origial "dark" arena
found in square1, while the other being lighter (but not to the extreme
of sq1).

The Objective is to kill the opponent more than the opponent kills you.

POINT SYSTEM:
Normal frag scoring:
Blue Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody
Red Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody
Yellow Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody
Green Team - 1 frag everytime you kill somebody


======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake,
Strato[CE] for the sample readme.txt, Blood of the Fold for all of 
their support in my mapmaking abilities, sHoCkWavE[FOLD] for doing
the fun name ascii stuff, and Birdcrap[FOLD] for coming up with the
original brilliant idea of Square1 and for being the main play tester.

The main reason this map was made is so more than one duel can take place
on a single server, and also to please the people that prefer sq1's
brightness to the original square1. Please note that sq1 was NOT made by
me, but my name is on it as though it were my creation. Supporting sq1
is supporting people that hack maps--sq1 is just a light hacked version
of square1 (made without my consent mind you).
