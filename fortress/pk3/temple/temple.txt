* Other Info *

	There are two (2) files in the zip

	- temple.txt (this text file)
	- temple.bsp
	- cross.mdl
Put temple.bsp into your fortress/maps/ dir, I put all my maps here. QW and TF will find
them no problem.

This is my first Quake map, Please send any comments/suggestions/complaints to me.

This is a 2forts style map (yes another one) with 2 opposing buildings. But the interior
 is not a 2fort layout. There is a quad damage in the middle of the map. Take the cross 
 to the raised red altar in the lower main room of your temple.
