Game play:

Ever play baseball?
You start in your dugout.  When you leave, turn right if blue, left if red.  That'll take you straight to first base.
From first base, there are two doors to the pitchers mound.  Red and Blue.  Red Ball behind Red Door.  Blue ball behind Blue door.  Duh.
get the enemy ball!  Run the bases!  Then get home for the homerun!
You can run the bases in ANY ORDER.  But you have to hit home last.
For those from Oz and other places lacking baseball knowledge, The bases run COUNTERCLOCKWISE from 1st to 3rd.  The outfield is behind 2nd base, and the 4th base is HOME.
IF you need to resupply, try the area between second and third base for the shortstop resupply room.  Left and Right field are even better.  Center field is especially nice for goodies.
If you feel lucky, take a swing at bat.  Just jump the home base ramp.  You may go YARD!(American slang for hitting one out of the park[sigh... foregners...])
Each base you touch gives you a little something back.  HomeRun gives EVERYONE on your team a little something.
The ball, if dropped, goes away QUICK.  Don't wait around if you see it lying there.
That's it.  PLAY BALL!

TIPS:

If you have the ball, DON'T stand around and get in a firefight.  Fast and slippery running is a better bet for you.
That Ring of Shadows in the outfield... see it?  You CAN get it.  Try the left side of the tunnel below it...

KNOWN BUGS

None.


VERSION INFO

SPEED1.bsp 12-2-97
	Everyone who played it LOVED it.  Too bad that was the playtesters.  Never once ran on a server.

SPEED2.bsp 1-5-98
	Some small problems needed fixing, and as my much more popular map Hwhell was being redone, I thought I'd take a few minutes out to fix them.  This way, if anyone ever DOES play it, it'll work perfect.
	Fixed the Yard bug so you get the quad easier.  Also put a message at each base so you always know where you are.  Just walk up to the post, and it'll tell you.  By the way, Bases in Baseball run COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

SPEED2 revision A  3-1-98
	Lots of changes.  You wanna know what they are?  TOUGH.

			IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
	


Other Info
