Title                   : The Insane Train of Pain!
Filename                : train5.bsp

Description             : ctf with two stations linked by a train.
================================================================

* Play Information *

TeamFortress            : Yes, 10-16 players should work well
New Graphics            : Ikbase.wad and a couple of custom textures.
				
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 2.1, Q3Radiant 181 and notepad ;)

Known Bugs              : sometimes the flag will fall throught the floor on the train tracks if dropped, but it always comes back, theres also some clipping bugs that i cant do much more about.                 

Details: Capture the flag, two teams. A train connects both bases. You can get to the flag by going up either spiral or up the lift, cap the flag behind your lift. Theres no way to resupply without dying so make the most of your life.

Installation: put into fortress/maps dir, to take a look run your own server or "quake.exe -game fortress +map train5"
