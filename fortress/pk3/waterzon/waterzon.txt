WATERZONE!

omg its another zone map! well im not gonna do the usual text file cause im too lazy. 
ill just say that it was made by Lush and Vantage.
this is not the final release. this version is for playtesting.
right now we know the basic functionality of the map works.
we just need to test whether or not the map can handle a 10 v 10.
we are gonna need a few good playtests to do that.
any bugs you find, please mail to rel@san.rr.com

here are the rules:

- there are two bases: gold base and jade base. 
- each base contains 3 zones. 
- capture 4 zones for 5 points. 
- capture 5 zones for 10 points. 
- capture 6 zones for 40 points. 
- the map begins with each team controlling 3 zones on opposite sides of the map.
- when all zones are captured, the map resets to its beginning state.
- to capture a zone you must stand on the zone's capture square for 3 seconds. 
- the player that captures a zone receives 10 seconds of quad and pentagram. 
- when a zone is captured, only enemies in the zone's resupply are killed.
- when a zone is captured, the capturing team gains access to the zone's respawn
 and resupply while the losing team relinquishes access to these facilities.

now i'll say that this is very similiar to fortzon, but due to the size of this map,
we had to make some changes on the ents.

here are some noticeable changes:

- when a zone is captured only the enemies in the resupplies will die.
all enemies in the main zone area will not die.
- the player that captures a zone gets 10 secs. of quad and pent.
thats enough to clear out a zone but not enough to capture another one.
- there are indicators in this map but only in the base and lava zones.
the aqua zone doesnt have one because you can see the flag from far away.
-the aqua zone comes equipped with a 5 minute biosuit so aqua zone defenders can defend
without worry of air supply. no other zones have this.

heres the controversial part:

-since only the aqua zones contain biosuits, if you lose access to the aqua zones,
your team will be in a bad position. its still possible to recapture an aqua zone
without a biosuit but it takes some teamwork. people might not like this
but every map has a situation similar to this one.
