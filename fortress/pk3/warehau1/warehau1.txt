updated Oct. 97

I added a water way between forts and a back door to the flag.
I also made it so there should be no telefrags and changed
the resupplies(thanks realistik).  I think the new spawn
design will be really cool for clan battles.  There are 14
spawnpoints for each team and they are all in the air.

* Other Info *

This map is designed to be played by two teams. Each team has there own
base. The objective is to get the enemy's flag from their basement and
return it to the platform in your base while keeping the enemy from getting
your flag.  You get 2 points for getting the flag and 8 for returning it.
It won't be easy.
