Notes                   : I have been getting sick of all the hacks out there
                          that were for regular 2fort4, but liked the map and
                          seen how I could change it a bit to make a classic
                          come back, and make a few changes that I felt was a
                          good revision.  Thanks to the people that helped with
                          the ideas.. Digital Jedi, AssChunk, Entropy, and a few
                          others that helped make this possible. Enjoy, and do
                          not worry about the hacks anymore, the .map will NOT
                          be released. =]

Things changed           :#1-) the bump in the red base is gone YAY
                          #2-) the texturess are all fixed no more mixed
                               textures that look very confusing.  
                          #3-) Lighting, its more even in both bases, for instance
                               the Red base no longer has a shadow in the key room
                               and the blue base has a dark grate now.
                          #4-) Elevator has been changed, it has a delay on it so
                               more than 1 person has time to get on it without
                               good timeing, also speaking of which, it also will
                               go up and down no matter if a person is on it or not
                               meaning the person who likes to talk while standing
                               on the elevator will not be a factor, cause it in time
                               will come back down. (meaning you can id this dumb ass)
                          #5-) the walls on the red and blue side have been evened out
                               near the sniper deck so that you can gren jump over both
                               now.
                          #6-) the upper supply door has been made wider so not only 2
                               people can fit in at once, but also makes the people who
                               like to build sentries a bit sad.
                          #7-) some of the walls, and other things (entities) have been
                               changed so that people can NOT use the hacked version of
                               2fort4, (they coudln't even edit the version of 2fort4hack
                               if they had it to make it like this map.  so no more hacked
                               maps YAY, and no I am not going to release this .map file =]
