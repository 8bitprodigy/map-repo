Section 5 
======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress "Defender's Nightmare" map.

There are 2 teams to this map. Gameplay is like 2fort4. If
the opposing team is not very good at defense, the flag
can be retrieved in about 30 seconds. There are 4 ways into
the flag room and 5 ways out. (You might have to look around 
a little....8)

Changes since Defend1: Cleaned it up...and of course, made
it harder to defend the flag...

POINT SYSTEM:
1 Frag for a kill, 10 Frags for capturing the flag.  


Section 6
======================= Misc Information ======================== 

Thanks go out to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for
Quake, and my son for providing great ideas. Also thanks to 
Chris Wright for TFNewbies, which makes it so easy to get started.
And of course, the GameSpy folks...for making it so easy to find
the servers.
If you put this map on a good server, I would appreciate an email
so I can come play it!
This is my first quake map so be gentle. =)
