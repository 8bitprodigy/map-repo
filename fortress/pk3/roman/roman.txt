* Description *

Yet another 1on1 map.  This is one where I had the idea for a long time, 
relatively simple idea, but I finally got around to finishing it up.

This is my third 1on1 map, and like Thunderdome (tdome.zip) and Kung Fu Arena
(4kfa.zip) I've tried to keep fairly simple.  This map is basically eye-candy,
very similar to 1on1r or pduel, but I think a couple of things will make it
different.  The pillars mean it's harder for people to back away and play
defensively.  Secondly, because of the "multi-level" nature of the arena, it's
probably a lot easier to take splash damage, because no matter where you are,
you and your opponent have a better angle on each other to shoot for splash
damage.  Anyway, that's it for now, have fun!
