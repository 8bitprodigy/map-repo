* Other Info *

It's a capture-the-flag map designed to be 
played by two teams.

There is a flag in the center of the map, which must be captured and
returned to the players base.

When someone has the flag they glow, move at half-speed, and are prevented
from entering some sections of the map.

It is difficult for a player to enter an enemy base, due to the defences.

There are resupply points under the ramps in each base.

It has not been tested in a team game, some please mail me about
any problems with the map.

How to use this map:
Copy the deathx.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map deathx" (without the quotes)
