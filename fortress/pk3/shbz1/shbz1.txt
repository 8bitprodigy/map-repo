Description             : Muhahahah! I finally understand Teamfortress entities. Sort of. Well, a 			  little bit :) Actually. Had to rely heavily on loads of tutor.txt files 			  I found, cos the one's with teamfortress rant on about stuff I can't 			  understand. Ho hum. Anyway, read the bottom for more :)
Additional Credits to   : ID (I get sick of people saying it, but I suppose I owe it to them :)
			  Everybody I know who I can beat at TF (not many, dammit). Thanks for 			  the ego boost :)

You may distribute and modify this level, as long as you include my
text file and give me credit. I don't get why you'd want to, though.
Also this file (and the others) cannot be sold for profit, cos I don't like people who do dat. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr................

* Where to get this Map *

You're looking at it, DoH!


*Other poo about this map*
The map is the first in a series of (hopefully) ever improving Teamfortress levels. I'm not planning any more for the next week at least, cos I'm gonna spend longer on the next one.
The reason for the name? Saltyhamster is the name I use on the TF circuit. So if you see me online, join my team and give me a hand, I'll need it :)
The objectives, right then!
The button on the bridge will raise/lower the cages around the flags (in BOTH outposts!). The all you have to do is get the flag, and bring it to you're pad in you're base. The whole run takes about 10 seconds with the scout, but when there's another team trying to do the same to YOUR flag, a lot of complications can arise.

Anyway. I reckon that not many people will be prepared to put this map on their servers, because of it's size. Nevertheless it makes for some BRILLIANT TF action with 4-12 players, because of the concept of the capping.

*More poo*
Anyone who wants to fiddle with this, or use it as a base. that's why I given you the map.
Any feedback? Drop me a line at christhorpe@bigfoot.com. I NEED FEEDBACK BEFORE I START ANOTHER MAP!!!!
I do have an ICQ number, BTW, but I'm gonna want to check you're sane through e-mail first ;)
The r_speeds throughout the map are at 400, if anyone's interested. I'd love to hear how to get this down, and I'd love even more if someone can give me some tips about sniping in TF :)
AnYwAy, ThIs Is Me SiGhNiNg OfF. ByE ByE :)
