Thanks to               : Id, The guys at TeamFortress, Raistlin for the cool EntEd,
                        : My brother Neil (Lucifer) and friends Chris, Lyndon, Russ

* Game play *
Unlike most previous maps for 2 team which have one flag in each team base, this
map only has one flag which starts mid-way between both bases. Whoever gets the flag
must return it to his/her team base flag room and place it on the grey flag rest. 
You won't get any frags or team points for doing this. 
For every minute the flag stays in your flag room, your team will receive one point. 
For every five minutes you hold the flag, all members of the defending team will 
receive 5 frags. 
The enemy team will have no flag to defend so they all need to attack the team 
defending the flag and get it back to their flag room.
There is a water grate that can be opened/closed by detpacks (stolen idea from Well6)
leading into both flag rooms, and a secret door into the column room (where the 
spawn rooms are next to).

* Map History *
This map started life based on my brother Neils old doom deathmatch level (sorry,
can't remember the name). The oustide area between the team bases was kept open (and
fairly basic) to keep the speed up for the mass battles that usually happen there).
I am not too sure how this will run on a Quakeworld server due to how many players
that could possibly be in the same area together. Maybe someone could let me know
if they decide to use it on a server so I could find out.
The one flag idea came about after someone mentioned doing the same thing on the TF
map makers mailing list.

* My Other Maps *
tf_attdef  : My first map ever! (and it shows :)
             A TF map designed for attack and defend with 2 teams
mbase_tf   : A 2 team TF map with 2 identical bases seperated by a large body of water.
             One of the first TF maps to use coloured textures to identfy the base that
             you are in.
massivTF   : My third map and first (released anyway) using the way-cool editor Worldcraft.
             This map is huge, I encountered the Quake map limits whilst designing this map.
             2 large bases seperated by an outside area with extensive waterways going into
             each base.
hexTF      : 2 Team, 1 flag idea. Get the flag from the middle into the ENEMYs base to get the
             points. I personally don't like this idea now, but let me know if you do :)
2evil2f    : (see below)

* Other Info *
There is also a standard 2 team, 2 flag version of this map called 2Evil2f for those
die-hard TeamFortress CTF people out there. (out soon, once it finishes compiling :)

If you like this level mail the server operators and let them know.

Any comments/suggestions/ideas welcome.

* How to use this map *
Copy the 2evil1f.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory.
