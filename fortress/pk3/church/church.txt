Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must capture the red flag from the small cupboard type room with the 
Quake symbol on the door of the enemy 
church, and take it to the baptistery (water) of the blue church.

The red team must do the same but the other way around.

If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it remains
for 30 seconds after which it returns to the cupboard.  Unlike standard CTF,
team members cannot return the flag by running over it. (yes this is very similar to the 2fort5
text file)

A demoman from each team can detpack the enemy altar to do damage to every member of the
enemy team. Damage includes loss of health, armor, ammo, grenades.

Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.

The map is designed for smaller sized games. From 2 - 16 players might be best but
you could experiment.

Hope you like it!
