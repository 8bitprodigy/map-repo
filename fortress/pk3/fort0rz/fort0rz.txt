* How to Play and Other Details *

Fort0rz - The Infiltration is an offence/defence or 'Infiltration' map. If you 
don't know how an offence/defence map works, or if this is your first time playing
Fort0rz - The Infiltration, or if you just need to recap on how to play - then 
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY!

How to play
-----------

BLUE TEAM - This is the Infiltration or Offence Team. Your task is to grab the flag 
located in the basement of the Defence Team's fort, then take it to the Command Centre
located in your barracks. Obviously, you'll have to face large amounts of enemy gunfire 
on the way in... and on the way out! Teamwork and communication is necessary to score.

RED TEAM - This is the Defence Team. Your task is to stop the Infiltration Team from
grabbing your flag and capturing it. Easy enough? Don't hold your breath... you won't 
score any points unless that flag is on that pad in that basement!

SPAWNING - Each team spawns within their respective 'bases'. The Defenders hold a fort 
similar in layout to the original 2fort5 fort, with the appropriate respawn and resupply 
rooms. The Infiltrators hold a 'barracks' with respawn areas being a rooftop respawn above 
the resupply room, and an outside canyon area with pipe access to the barracks.

GAMEPLAY AREAS - The Defence Team's territory extends across the water to just beyond 
the bridge. DEFENDERS CANNOT ENTER THE INFILTRATORS' BASE. If any Defenders cross the 
invisible boundary - they are killed, simple as that. The Infiltrators have full rein of 
the map excluding specific Defender respawn and resupply rooms.

SCORING - For each period of five minutes (300 seconds) that the flag remains on the pad 
in the basement, the Defence Team gains 10 team points. If the flag is elsewhere on the 
map, or is being carried by an Infiltrator, the Defence Team will not gain any points. 
The Infiltration Team gains 10 team points for each successful flag capture. In addition,
the capping player on the Infiltration side gains an extra 2 frags, but only if 
Indi-Frags mode is enabled.

LAYOUT - The map is essentially a made-over 2fort5, with the absence of a Blue fort. 

MISCELLANEOUS - Other miscellaneous tidbits:

	Ammo - Ammo 'dispensers' are found in every resupply area, with a respawn time 
	of 2 seconds. Look for wall-based pads with a hand etched into them.

	Medikits - There are medikit 'dispensers' in every resupply area. In the case
	of the Infiltration team, medikits are located in the Infirmary. These dispensers 		'respawn' after 15 seconds. Look for wall-based pads with medikit signs on them.

	Grenades - Gren1s can be found in every resupply area. However, to
	limit Gren2 spam, Gren2s are only available from the BASEMENT resupply
	room (for the Defence team), and from the COMMAND CENTRE (for the Infiltration
	team). Grenades respawn after 5 seconds.

	Armour - Armour is found in every resupply area, with a respawn time
	of 2 seconds.

	Detpacks - There are no respawning detpacks.

	The flag - 30 seconds after it is dropped by an Infiltrator, it will return to
	the basement. (This also resets the 300-second counting cycle for the Defenders)

TIPS AND SECRETS - Build up your own stockpile of tips and playing methods (like suitable defence/infiltration classes, etc). A word about secrets: there are none in this version.

Happy fragging!
