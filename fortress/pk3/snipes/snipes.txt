HOW TO USE THIS MAP:
--------------------
Copy the snipes.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map snipes" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the snipes.bsp
file into your quake\qw\maps directory, or if its a TF server, keep it in 
your quake\fortress\maps too.

*Snipes*
This was made because I thought we needed another "just Sniper" map. It's pretty 
good too. The lighting is just bright enough so its not really easy to hide in the
shadows, but you may have to search the shadows every once in a while.

*Overview*
This is a square, 3 level building with grass in the middle. The building is split
in half by glass on the level(s). you cannot break the glass, so dont try. All
you can do is Snipe, Snipe, Snipe! You know that you can only be a Sniper in this
map even though it lists all of them (dont know how to change that).


* Other Info *
If you like this level mail the server operators and let them know.
