* Other Info *
If you like this level mail the server operators and let them know.

This is a very large level.  2 fortresses with a central well room between
the two.  The flags are in the rooms at the top of the towers and you return
the flag to the bottom of the tower.

I built this level with the poly count in mind.  I have noticed some TF levels
get up to 1000 or more and this gets really bogged.  The grappling hook is
enabled but I built the level so you can still go to all parts of the map.

I put in 16 player spawns for each team so it will not be a a problem when
Quakeworld supports 32 players.

The scoring is 10 points for the capturing team and 1 frag per kill.
There are major base ammo rooms, medium ammo rooms for each team in the middle
and also some backpacks available to each team at both bases.

One nice feature is all the clips I used to keep you from gettin snagged on walls,
edges etc.  

How to use this map:
Copy the well1.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
