======================= Game Play ======================== 

This is a TeamFortress map.

There are 2 teams,
        1. Blue
        2. Red

POINT SYSTEM: Both teams spawn in the same area, team members run down the hallway, dodging various spike traps and teleport traps. Teleport traps are activated by two buttons near the respawn area, and take the players to one of two enclosed cells above the hallway where they wait. Once a player makes it all the way down the hall, he hits a button, giving his team 3 frags and activating "the crusher", which kills all players in the cells.

Big thanks to Network[OSKI] for helping me so much with all of my newbie editing questions, and to ID Software and T.F.S. for the obvious.
