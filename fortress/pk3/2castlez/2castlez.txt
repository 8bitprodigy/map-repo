* Changes from 2 Castlez v.5 *

1. Sniper Ledge is lowered to half its height.

2. Upgrade room (the computer room) now holds the capture point.

3. Each upgrade alcove has a button on the floor. Take a gem and step
   on it to release the powered-up version. This is a goal item. There
   is only one to take.

4. Cannon power increased to 75 damage and 50 armor. Any class on your
   team can fire it.

5. Three initial halls blocked off now. Lower sniper hall, elevator from
   one of the main spawn rooms to the sniper ledge, and the chute from
   the other spawn room to the upgrade room in the basement. They all
   open after the first capture.

6. New color-coded models.

* Other Info *

  This is a two team capture-the-flag type map. Each team has their
  own base, at opposite ends of the map.

  You must get inside the enemy base, and take their power gem. Then you
  return it to the computer room in your basement.

  Ordered Upgrade system:
  When you capture the enemy power gem, your base will upgrade. There are
  7 upgrades, after that, you just get the normal 10 points for
  captures. Upgrade list at end of file.

  When you take a gem to an upgrade alcove, you will use the gem to unlock
  a false panel and get the 10 team score. Now you can get the powered-up 
  version of the upgrade. This is an item, so there is only one per team.

If you wish to get the updates that I make by email, just email me with
the subject: Castlez Map
I will add you to the growing list, and notify you about changes I am
making and servers that are playing this map.

How to use this map:
Copy the castlez.bsp file into your 
quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps directory. 
Copy the .mdl files into your quake\fortress\progs directory.
Then run quake.
In the console, type "map castlez" (without the quotes)

If you want to play on a QW server running this map, copy the 
castlez.bsp file into your quake\qw\maps directory or into one of the 
directories above. It will work either way. I would appreciate any 
suggestions you may have.
******************************* Upgrades *******************************
These are the upgrades in order. There are 7 upgrades.

1. Extra sniper areas. When you get this upgrade, a door will apper at 
   the top of the ramp in the capture room. Through this door are 4 other 
   "exits". The teleport in front leads to the front of the base, at 
   ground level. The two side teleports lead to ledges in the room with the
   spike and the water. Shoot the panel in the floor to reveal the 4th
   teleport. This leads to the ledge on the side of the center of the map.
   Also extra halls from the two main spawn rooms.

2. Hand grenades. A panel in the computer-room (opposite of your flag) 
   will open to reveal floating grenades. Step into the alcove to max out 
   your special TF grenades.
   GEM POWERUP-Regenerating ammo

3. Medikits/Regeneration. The next panel in the computer room will open
   to reveal a Quake rune. When you grab it, your health is maxed out, and
   if you are a Medic, you will max out your medikits.
   GEM POWERUP-Regenerating health

4. Detpacks. The center panel is removed to show you a detpack. Grab 
   this for a detpack. No effect if you are not a Demoman.
   GEM POWERUP-Regenerating Detpacks. 1 every 30 seconds

5. Mega Armor. This is one of the best upgrades. When you grab it, you 
   will get armor that is resistant to all types of attacks.
   GEM POWERUP-Regenerating armour

6. Enchantment. Last computer room upgrade, this one looks like the 
   Pentegram on a chain. Grab it, and random number of seconds later it
   goes off and you get Quad Damage and Invisibilty for 10 seconds.
   GEM POWERUP-Multiple enchantment periods. 1 every 30 seconds for 5
     seconds.

7. Cannon. This cannon is mounted at the top of your castle. When a 
   teammate comes up behind it, it is triggered, and anything in it's 
   cone is blasted for 75 points of damage. Even your teammates, so be 
   careful. There is a red light placed on the cannon. When you can
   see it, you can fire the cannon.

That's it for the upgrades. If you would like to see me put in any 
other upgrades, mail me.

* Changes from Castlez4

1. File name changed.

2. Outside area changed, ladders to get out of water.

3. Back rooms were removed and redone.

4. Basement textures redone.

5. Added upgradable upgrades. Can upgrade the 2nd to 6th upgrades
   into more powerful versions if you take a gem to the alcove.

* Changes from Castlez3 *

1. The two main supply packs now provide special armour. One is
   kevlar(bullets) and the other is wooden(nails).

2. Cannon can now harm players standing behind the opposing balcony
   wall.

3. Cannon now has a red button at the back. You can fire it when the
   button is out.

3. Two .mdl files introduced. Amulet.mdl is the Enchantment model
   and powergem.mdl is the new flag model.

4. Enchantment power-up changed. Now when you get it, it is a delayed
   item. After a random number of seconds, it activates and gives you
   Quad Damage and Invisibility for 10 seconds. You can get them
   every 20 seconds.

5. The center altar upstairs can now be det-packed. The advantage to
   this besides the 5 points is that the owner of the altar
   can not spawn there until the engineer repairs the altar with his
   wrench. The engineer also gets 5 points for repairing the
   altar.

6. New startup menu.

7. Ceilings above two of the bridges in each "spike" room are higher
   up. This prevents players from sometimes getting stuck on them and
   going into the water.

8. Lighting changed in some areas. Makes for a darker environment.

9. The center sniper pit no longer is invisible. This turned out to
   be unfair for others because they couldn't see the people in there.
   The two sniper ledges on the side remain the same.

* Changes from Castlez2 *

1. All supply packs supply even more ammo; everyone was complaining<g>.

2. Architecture changes

3. Added access to roof and basement from the two main spawn rooms.

4. Added water grate. Only team members can pass it. Or you must detpack
it from below.

5. Elevator in basement moves faster. Much faster!

6. Cannon REALLY works. It also has a wider spread. Only a demoman can
fire it. And please be careful, the cannon can kill your teammates.

7. Only snipers can open the door in the capture room.

8. Added textures

* Changes from Castlez1 *

1. All supply packs now supply twice the nails; medics were complaining.

2. Took out some blocks, and changed the texture on triggers to cut down
on lag, and on people running GL.

3. The cannon now works. It does not use grenades. Instead, a demoman
just "shoots" it (he walks up to the back), and it fires a 50 damage
shot that hurts anyone (even teammates) that are in the effect cone 
from the cannon mouth.
