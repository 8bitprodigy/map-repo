* The Map *

  This is a two team, storm the base type map.

* Goal *

	The idea is simply for Team 2 (Red) to get into the base in the 
clouds.  Once inside six switches must be pressed, this will release the
exit door at the top of the level.  Team 1 (Blue) must prevent Team 2 
from achieving those goals.

	Try out the wind cannon (I've not seen it elsewhere)it is in the 
cave.  It takes some practice to get a good firing position.  But if 
you stand on the small block and fire at the red marker 9 out of 10
times you will be successful.  The other times are backfires :-)


* Other *

	This is my first level I've created so please be nice to me :-)
I've tried hard to get rid of any leaks (I cheated doing it though, by 
bounding the whole map with an even bigger box) and I've also tried to 
keep the poly count down.

	I haven't had the chance to play my level with more than 2 
players, so please tell me if it's unplayable with lots of people 
running about.

	Please email me with any other thoughts, thanks.  Enjoy!
