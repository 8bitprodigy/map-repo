Size:	This map is intended for 6-10 player games (total).  There's enough
		spawnpoints to have 12 people on each team, but that would get
		ridiculous once people start shooting :)

Gameplay:   Each team controls a valley-like area, and are separated from
		eachother by a hill/valley in between.	Enter the enemy bunker,
		take their flag, and bring it to the hill between the two team's
		areas.  At the start a large rock will block passage to the
		flags; once detpacked, the rock will disappear for a period of
		five minutes.

	    Scoring (team / individual frags in addition to teamfrags):
		- Detpacking enemy rock - 2 / 1
		- Destroying enemy rock (by weapons other than detpack) - 0 / 0
			- the above is not a typo, you must detpack it for points
		- Grabbing the flag (at any time) - 0 / 1
		- Capturing the flag - 10 / 3

            Respawns:	You spawn/respawn in a room with 5 teleporters to
		locations within your team's valley.  If someone is standing on
		a teleport location, a door blocking that teleport will close
		temporarily.  (Thanks for the idea go to [T]-Cathodelysis)

	    Spam Detector:  The first two teleport locations (first two
		teleporters from the left) are vulnerable to nail spam, so there
		is a large metal post up there that will warn everyone on your
		team not to use these teleporters for the time being.

	    Supplies:	The respawn-room supplies are complete, but they will
		TAKE AWAY ALL OF YOUR GREN2s.  You also cannot return to the
		respawn room upon teleporting (except by death).
		Once you arrive on the map, you can resupply at the ammo shacks
		in each	team's area, or you can use a resupply in a cave near the
		top of the hill between the teams.  This resupply is the only
		source of gren1s on the map.

            Detpacks:	As said before, at the start, you must detpack the enemy
		rock to gain access to the flag.  However, you can also detpack
		the enemy supply shack (detpack must be inside the shack), and
		deny the enemy any supplies for 30 seconds.
	  
	    "Bam4 ladders": The metal texture embedded into a hillside in each
		of the team-controlled areas is a "Bam4 ladder" -- jump onto
		the rock under it and walk into the ladder to climb.

CHANGES SINCE v3.0

Fixed: Your team should get 10 frags when you cap.  Previously, only the capping
	player would get frags (although the teamscore worked perfectly).

Fixed/Changed: The pack in the middle of the map now gives you 50 armor, not 100.

Changed: The packs in the spawn rooms now give you health (in case you accidentally
	blast yourself or something =)

CHANGES SINCE v2.0

Changed: You no longer get any teamfrags for touching the flag.  You also only
	get one frag for a touch (any flag touch, not just the first).

Changed: The rocks blocking the flag return after five minutes of being destroyed.

Changed: The wind tunnel that slowly lowers you to the ground in the respawn
	is longer, so you have to wait in the respawn longer.

Added: The respawn-room supplies steal your gren2s.  You'll have to choose;
	enter the warzone fully armed/armored or have spam to play around with.
