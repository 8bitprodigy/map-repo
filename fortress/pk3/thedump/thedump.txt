        ok, if you're a demoman who wants to destroy people and stuff
go to the top floor and drop down into the cannon room, throw mirv grenades
into the pit thing and their daughter grenades will nuke any incomings.
hehe.

        update: longer bridge so that dorks can't just sprint across it
they must face the cannon!
        doors on food rooms so no idiots can take your stuff.
        wind tunnels on cannon openings so grenades don't kill cannon
        operators.
        funny message to people who try 'ride the cannon'.
