* Other Info *

  This map is designed to be played by two teams, one defending and the
other attacking.

  Team one is the defending team, and must hold the fort for ten minutes.

  Team two is the attacking team, and must infiltrate the fort.

  Once a member of team two reaches a point at the rear of the fort, they
have won the game.

  In order for this map to be fair, there needs to be a 2:1 ratio
of defenders to attackers.


How to use this map:
Copy the siege3.bsp file into your quake\id1\maps or quake\fortress\maps
directory. Then run quake.
In the console, type "map siege3" (without the quotes)
