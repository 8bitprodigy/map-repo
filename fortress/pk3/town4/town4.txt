This map is similar to town2 (if you have played it)
Team one = Bad guys
Team two = Evil guys
Team three = The Cops

The object of this map is for team one to defend their base while
trying to destroy team two's lab. (1 frag per comp in lab)
Team two has to defend their base while trying to destroy team one's
computers. (1 frag per 486)
Team three has to aquire a suitcase from either team one or team two's
base and take it back to their base. (5 frags each suitcase)

There is also a credit card in each base. These credit cards are the 
way to supply. Simply take the credit card from your base and run to 
the nearest ATM to supply you and your whole team with armour, ammo,
grenades, etc. Also remember every team can use anyones credit card.
