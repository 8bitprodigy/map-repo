* Other Info *

This map plays like a standard ctf map with a few exceptions...
To capture their core (flag) you have to first hit the button in their
control room... this is the huge room with all the screens (VERY hard to 
miss), it's also a choke point so you'll have to go through it unless they're 
willing to toggle their elevator for you... once you've hit their button, 
their core will be exposed for 4 minutes, before it closes again.  You should 
to make sure that the button is down before running upstairs to their flag, 
it's not much fun to get there and realize you can't get it...

Also another thing, the elevators can only be operated by that base's team,
but engineers on either team can toggle the elevators remotely from the
control rooms

If this is the first time you're playing the map, i STRONGLY suggest you go 
blue... that base is fully lit and has maps in the respawn rooms... the red
base is very dark and easy to get lost in at first...

The resupplys work a little differently than you would expect... the 
backpacks containing armor, health, and ammo can be picked up by anyone, on
either team, but the grenades can only be picked up by your team.  The 
explosives room contains mostly class-specific grenades, you can get a full
load of emps every 4 seconds, mirvs every 15 seconds, 1 nail gren every 
15 seconds and a detpack every 30... i didn't want people spraying the area 
with nails, sorry soldiers... you can always get grens in the rocket boxes

Err... that's about it, enjoy :)
