 -goody.wav									      by Blur )

======================= Game Play ======================== 
This is a TF capture the flag map, based on (my) idea of (what) WWI trenches (should have been like). I took some ideas from 2FORT5, because everyone seems to enjoy it so much.

UNIQUE FEATURES:
The bridge in the middle can be destroyed by a detpack, and rebuilt by an engineer.
Also, when your team captures the flag, you get a 'kill frenzy' for 10 secs - Quad and Invincibility. (though if you're one of those people who waits in the enemy flag room, then you're locked in through out it. HAHAHAHA!)


======================= Misc Information ======================== 
Thanks to TFS for making TeamFortress, id software for Quake, Lithium Software for making QOOLE and the tutorial, my cousin, Haarg2 for testing it, and TFConsole, for being so damn useful! And anyone else for making the utilities used.

This is my first quake map so be gentle. :)
