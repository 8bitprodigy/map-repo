Section 5 
======================= Game Play ======================== 

The objective of this map is to keep Mr Hankey "The Flag". There are 4 forts to start in.
Mr Hankey scores 20 points each time he is taken. All of the forts are off limits to the
flag bearer "Mr Hankey Holder", if you get to close to the doors you will explode. There 
are water tunnels between each of the forts, which lead to Mr Hankey's pit. 
This is a very fast map and me and my cohorts have been enjoying it on the company LAN.
Thanks to Rev Hippie for the keep away version of 2forts5. Thanks to Kevin Coyne "Joey", and
Brian O'Connor "saspuke" for their suggestions with the overall design of this map.



POINT SYSTEM:
Take Mr Hankey from the pit 20 Team Points.
