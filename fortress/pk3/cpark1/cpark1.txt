Gameplay: Capture the enemy team's chicken.  It can be found in their basement.
	  This is very similar to the capture the flag style of many other TF 
	  maps.  There are 2 main differences in this particular map.

		Security System
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		There is a security system in each base.  It is a large screen
		in the main ramp room which alerts defenders to the presence of 
		enemy players.  It has four warnings:
			a) Front - Someone is coming through the front door
			b) Water - Someone is coming through the water
			c) Balcony - Someone is coming in via the balcony
			d) Lift - Someone is coming through the back passage
				  towards the lifts.
		The security system can be disabled by entering the security
		office from the ramp room and doing sufficient damage to the
		computer inside.  If your team can disable the enemy security
		system, you gain 2 points and it will not work for 3 minutes.
		It is then restored and can be disabled again for more points.

		Detpacks
		~~~~~~~~
		Another difference in this map is that the back passage to the lifts
		is blocked by obstacles that can only be removed by detpacks.  There
		are two walls.  The second wall (closest to the lifts) cannot be
		repaired.  However the first wall can be repaired by an engineer
		by hitting the main piece of wood across the ground.  It has to be
		hit about twenty times before it is repaired.

		Why chickens?
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Because there are too many ctf-maps around and it was all I could
		think of. =)  Also, it made naming the level much easier.
