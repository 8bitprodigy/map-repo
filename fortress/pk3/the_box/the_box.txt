Description             : This map is made for the 
                          Team Fortress Patch (v1.3x or 2.0x). It won't be
                          fun playing it without the patch.

* Play Information *

  This map does not work properly without the 
  TeamFortress QuakeC patch, which can be downloaded from 
  http://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/
  or
  http://www.nano.no/~liam/tf/

  This is a capture-the-flag map designed for _four_ teams (Well, 2 or 3 teams can play
  it as well). The goal is to capture the flag, that's located underground. To get there,
  just fall down the hole that's in the middle of the map. Then get the flag, and use one
  of the teleporters to get back to the surface. And then run back to your base, and drop
  the flag at the dropoff point (which is located at the end of the "pill box", beside the
  wall light).

                          So I had to start all over again, but this time, I knew exactly
