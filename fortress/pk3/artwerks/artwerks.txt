Description             : The level is 2fort5'ISH. I like 2fort5 and 
			  everything... but it needs a twist ya know? So 
			  why not blow up some fine art? MAKES SENSE 
			  TO ME! Anyway, in order to cap you must be 
			  a demoman, go to the enemys art room located
			  (going up the ramp) to the right and behind 
			  you. Unique to this level, as far as i know 
			  are the people shooters. Players can lob 
			  themselves over the riverie pond thing and 
			  slam face first into the opposite bases outer
			  wall. They work as grenade launchers... but 
                          there not accurate at all. In order to open 
                          the court yard gates one must shoot the button 
			  located on the lower sniper roost. The rest of
			  the map is pretty straight forward.


Install Notes           : Just unzip to c:/ drive or whatever you have 
			  your HD as (my default cd rom is m:/ who in 
			  hell was the genius who thought up that? what
			  was it, pick random letters outta the alpabet 
			  day?)
