=================================================================

Details:

Best played with watervis turned off.  Snipers get it too easy in TF anyhow.

Secrets: 2 * DETPACKABLE DOORS !  Thats it.

Recommended attack strategy:  Go in in teams and communicate !	

I made the respawn grates non shoot-throughable to minimise respawn spamming.
