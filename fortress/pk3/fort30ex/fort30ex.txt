* Other Info *

This map uses CTF style and very small. A map fort30 however 
is more than prevouse. It is made on advice Mathieu Perrenoud 
(http: // www-iis.unil.ch / ~ mperreno/sentry.html)
Which has found in the old version some bugs. I hope them has 
corrected. Besides are added underwater pass, and also award 
for capture enemy a flag!
	This best for quik death!
Your goal is to retrieve the enemy flag, return your base touch
your base with the enemy's (Capturing the Flag). This map may be
too small for a 8 player game, future maps will be larger,
I apologize for this.
