    -------------------------------------------------------------
                      Changes since v2.0

 - Fixed version info all over, it now really reads v3.0

 - Added Query info to flag entities.

 - Removed lifts from bunkers and replaced them with ladders.

 - Added a small ledge in flag room.

 - Fixed respawn door entities, now if you stand right under the
   door of your own respawn, you won't get gibbed. I wouldn't
   try that on enemy respawn though :)

 - The water entrance into base has been revamped at it's base
   entry point, in order to limit view.

 - Put up some ON/OFF markings on the walls behind alarm switches.
   In order to make for easier navigation.

 - Replaced medi-kits with the Medi-Pack in respawns.

 - Removed some annoying edges from the flag hall entry that really
   annoyed laggy players trying to make a smoothe run.

 - Put Clip textures in various spots near flag hall entrance,
   in order to remove all possibility of players getting snagged
   in the scenery. This is really helpful in laggy games.

 - Put Clip textures under the ramps, now players cannot get stuck
   under the ramps, like in other maps, you just strafe smoothly
   off from the offending invisible wall, which is placed a few units
   away from the spot you would normally squeeze into.

 - Changed outside wall texture.

 - Water is now NOT transparent in GL. I like the fact that something
   really awful could be lurking down there. Unseen.

 - Probably a few other things I completely forgot to mention.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Changes since v1.0

 -  Major Bug fixed in Flag Capture Entities, which would award the
                   team 10 frags, but the player who brought the
                   flag back, would not get the frags.

                   Player who makes the capture, gets 1 frag extra

 -  Fixed Sniper Nest ledges, which were too high and blocked snipers
                   firing angle. Now snipers can more easily fire at
                   oncoming troops.

 -  Fixed Middle floor windows. They also were too narrow, and players
                   had a hard time firing through them, and were limited
                   to long range only, since it blocked most of the
                   terrain in front of the fort.

 -  Fixed TF Entities which displayed messages, near computer banks
                   on the top floor, so players had to be closer to
                   them. This was to avoid having constant messaging
                   when you enter the tight space.

 -  Fixed certain dark areas, which were mostly a real hassle in GLquake.
                   Such as the respawn entrances and tunnel entrances.
                   Due to the diminished visibility of those light bars
                   in GL. This was fixed by adding a very dim light,
                   which is barely visible in normal play, but makes a
                   big difference in GL.

 -  Updated and added usefull info in the OUTPOST2.TXT

 -  GL VISed with Transparent water.

    I had received very few comments from players, I guess everyone
  figures someone else will have noticed it. But I would like to thank
  the following people who have helped me make this a better map.

    Bob Marotte, WildeFire & Ash for his New Maps server, which
  enabled me to playtest my map on a real server.

    Hopefully with the major bug fix, players will be more inclined
  to try it.

 This is a variation of the usual & popular Capture the Flag
Team Fortress Maps. Two forts face each other, and two military
forces of space marines struggle for domination.

 The action takes place on a remote but strategic outpost. Two
Clans have been able to seize control of the compound, also
making sure their SlipGates will pump a steady flow of reinforcements
as the battle rages on.

    ------------------------------------------------------------

 This map was designed with the player in mind. Efforts were made
to make the map both eye pleasing and interesting in gameplay.
I have taken into consideration many comments from players, and
various web pages, aimed to help map makers create a map that will
interest players of any class and style of play.

 Points of interest:

   SECURITY SYSTEM   Each base has a Security System, which can
                     be activated and de-activated by any class
                     from either team. It's easier to destroy than
                     it is to create.

                     The security system will also warn of spies, so
                     keep your eyes peeled.

                     Unlike many maps, I have made this security
                     system broadcast the ALARM messages to each
                     team player, so no one has to just stand there
                     and stare at some texture.

                     Here are some usefull details to know.

                              ON  Switch health 1000
                              OFF Switch health  500

                              Switch Delays 120 seconds

   BUNKERS           There are four military bunkers placed in the
                     courtyard, surrounding the landing pad. They
                     have their advantages and disadvantages. It
                     will be for the player to figure out!

   THE UNDERGROUND   The underground system of tunnels, connects
                     all four bunkers and offers a way into the
                     water and sewage system.

   THE BRIDGE        Should it stay? Or should it go?
                     In larger games, the underground could play
                     a large role, since enemies could secure
                     the bunkers closest to their enemies and
                     put dispensers and certain personnel such
                     as medics for before assault ready. Not to
                     mention scouts will play a more important
                     role, trying to notify their teams of hidden
                     troops. The bridge can be both an advantage
                     and a disadvantage.

     Thanks to AsH (AsH@mc.net) I was able to do some server
  playtesting, unfortunately I still haven't been able to get
  a nice game going with at least 5 players in each team.

     I hope players will contact me and share their views and
   opinions.

     Thank you for your time, and happy hunting!
