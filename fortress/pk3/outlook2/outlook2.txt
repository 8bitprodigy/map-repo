Release Notes:

At first glance this might seem like "Just another boring capture the flag style
team fortress map".  Look again.

This map has a number of features to enhance the strategic value.  As one person
said, Team Fortress is "The Thinking Man's" Quake.  There is only one flag that both 
teams have to fight over.  Once you have the flag, take it into the enemy base to one
of the scoring points.  There are 3 scoring locations worth 1, 5 and 15 points, each
one is harder to get at than the previous.  To make things really interesting there
are a number of strategic switches.  

One switch creates a *very* quick shortcut to the 1 point scoring location.  This
switch is located at the end of the hallway that you see immediately upon entering
the enemy's base.  The shortcut can be toggled up and down. The enemy can toggle
this shortcut by pressing on their button in the sniper tower.

A second key point is a small wooden wall in the opponent's base.  This can be blown
up with a detpack and it reveals a "sanctuary" for the enemy.  Don't let your enemy's
have access to this sanctuary!  A few hits from an engineer spanner will repair the
wall.

The third switch is actually a pair of switches.  One switch will activate your team's
teleporters.  The other switch will de-activate the other team's teleporters if they
are currently active.  The teleporters are extremely powerful allowing you to move
from your respawn into the sanctuary or from your respawn room directly to the flag.

Don't hold on to the flag for too long.  If you hold it for more than 90 seconds the
map assumes you're hording the flag which is very boring for everybody and will kill
you.  As long as you actively try to score the flag this will never be a problem.

Note also that while the red armour dispenses 200 red armour every second, it will
only give 25 cells to engineers every second.  This is to place a limit (without the
use of dispensers) on how fast an engineer can get a gun to level 3. Without this
limit we would be seeing level 3 sentry guns appear within the span of 5 seconds.
(which is still possible with a dispenser but requires a higher commitment of 
resources).
