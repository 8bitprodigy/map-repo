* Game Play *

  If you dont know how to play a capture the flag/2fortX type of 
map by now (1 day old newbies excluded) then please take the nearest
blunt object you can find and do the world a favor.
  Now i've gotten complaints about some of my maps in the past, "endi
i'm loooost" "endi im confused" "endi i've lost feeling in my right side"
Well this time no one can complain. All the sections are very different
from each other and it's actually a simple design.

A few things to take note of:
1) There are 3 ways IN and 2 ways OUT of the basement.
2) The elevator (one way in and out of the basement) and the area
   around it will suck all cells away. This was done so that sentries
   cannot be used to block the elevator. 
   Pyros, engineers and HW's will be most effected by this as their 
   weapon strenth is diminished byt the loss of cells.
3) The respawn area that starts near the ceiling of the right side of your
   base has a air current that will take you back up top. Also when you
   spawn at this point you CAN fall down without damage by using the 
   platform on the wall below you.
4) To cap the flag take it back to where your own flag rests in the 
   basement.

 * Other Info *
This map is a rehash of my old map tourney for any who notice the 
resemblance. I basically kept only the bridge and the basement but
even those were changed, everything else was done new from scratch.


I hope you all have a good time with it, cause thats what its all about
