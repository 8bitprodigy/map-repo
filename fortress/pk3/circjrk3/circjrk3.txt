* Gameplay *

This map is slightly similar to The Hunted President.  The blue team is
the only one that can carry the flag.  When a blue guy grabs the flag, he
keeps it until he dies.  He has to get to the pit and leap in.  When he
does, all of blue team scores.  Red team has to prevent him from getting
there--when the blue flagbearer is killed, the red team gets points.

There is a gold key in the red ledge on the water side.  If a blue player
carries it to the machine in the lower floor of the red supply shack, the
entire team becomes invisible for eight (8) seconds, then visible for two
(2).

If anyone shoots the button on the outside of the shack, the lava bridge
sinks.
