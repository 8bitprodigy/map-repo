Description             : Basically a normal type of map.  A little more
                          basic than 2forts but still has just as much room
                          for strategy.

Build Time              : About 2 1/2 days for the actual map, the update
                          took about 1 hour.
Upgrade Details         : Fixed a lag problem and made the lower resupply
                          door smaller to make camping harder.  Also fixed
                          a few text problems.
=================================================================

Details:

  This map is designed specifically for the TeamFortress quakec
patch v2+.

It is capture the flag style map, with the following objectives:

The blue team must capture the red flag from the roof of the enemy 
base, and take it to the top ramp of the blue base.

The red team must capture the blue flag from the roof of the enemy 
base, and take it to the top ramp of the red base.

Each team must try prevent the opposing team from achieving their objectives.

If the flag carrier is killed, they drop the flag to the ground where it
remains for 30 seconds after which it returns to the roof.  Unlike
standard CTF, team members cannot return the flag by running over it.

Enjoy!
